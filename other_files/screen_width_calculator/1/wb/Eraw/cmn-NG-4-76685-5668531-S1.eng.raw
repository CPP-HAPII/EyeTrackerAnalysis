[You mention that I always//You don't say, I always//Since you mention this, I always//It is real that I always] had a very big question about The [Water Margin//Outlaws of the Marsh]. What's so good about this book on earth that it [is grouped as one of//sneaked into] the four great classic novels.
There are excellent parts of the book, but as a novel, the makeup of characters [is quite flawed//have some flaws]. For example, this Hu San Niang, with all her [loved ones//relatives] recklessly slaughtered by Li Kui, if she had any guts at all, she should have fought it out with that guy. Yet she became sworn sister with her enemy and degraded herself by marrying a short ugly man. What is the hell going on here.
This group of so-called heroes did some righteous deeds, but they did a lot of lousy things as well.
[By mentioning that,//It is real that] it's a lot like a novel about gangster lowlifes. If [a boy uses//boys use] this book as inspiration, it seems [he//they] would have a great chance of going down the road of a criminal lowlife.
In terms of its historical themes, it diverges too much from real history. Song Jiang's uprising was not that awe-inspiring. It seems it was quelled by [royalist Zhang Shuye//Zhang Shuye who was sent by Imperial Court].
In my opinion, The [Water Margin//Outlaws of the Marsh] is simply not on par with the other three books.
