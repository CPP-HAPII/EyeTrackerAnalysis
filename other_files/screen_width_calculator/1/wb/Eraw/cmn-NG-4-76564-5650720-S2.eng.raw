I think that sometimes it is not a bad thing to be ticketed by Uncle Policeman.
I remember reading a post by a fellow student, who said that he was in a very complicated frame of mind after seeing his parents taking off at the airport, and sped up to 120 miles on the highway while listening to Swan Lake.
I have never driven on the highway, but this should have been speeding, right.
I feel that he was extremely unlucky not to have encountered a police officer,
Some things, some people are just this way. [He//They] always [finds//find] you when there is nothing wrong, but [disappears//disappear] whenever [he is//they are] needed.
In a word, this fellow student had the real bad luck not to have encountered a police officer. In the end, he drove faster and faster until finally at 140 miles, he sped off the highway and plunged into the woods.
But fortunately, people's luck always tends to balance out. Although this fellow student did not encounter a police officer, at least he was not injured in the accident. It was said that he would have fallen into a river had he left the highway a moment later.
So upon getting [a ticket//tickets], just consider [it//them] the expense of averting [a disaster//disasters].
