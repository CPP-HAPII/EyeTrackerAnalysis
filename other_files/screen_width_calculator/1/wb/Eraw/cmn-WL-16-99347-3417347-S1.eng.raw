Two hundred and fifteen innocents were killed in Baghdad, with their limbs flown everywhere and flesh all over the bloody ground. This [results//resulted] in the biggest death toll since the deposing of Saddam.
The Sunni and Shiite factions have [quickly competed//tried to compete] to blame each other, making this shocking massacre, which no one [will//would] admit, seem even more horrific.
Bush, who can't even protect himself, has long given up his cowboy act.

There came the news of an explosion at Moscow University. No one was hurt, but it was a serious psychological blow.
Moscow University is a symbol of Russia. Its position is even higher than that of Harvard in the US.
If people's evil conduct even befalls such hallowed ground, then the hurt it [causes//caused] to the people's heart and even the president [can//could] be easily imagined. Putin was already feeling down and upset. 
The West [insists//insisted] that that defected spy who died in exile in London was eliminated on Putin's orders. They've gone on to [call Putin "a cold war schemer."//buckle Putin up with the hat named "a cold war schemer."]
The handsome and cool-styled Putin has become furious, with the Russian government issuing a very strongly worded denial as well.
