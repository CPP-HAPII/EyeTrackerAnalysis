As for Mao Zedong being "forgotten even by the common people", "scholars who study Chinese politics" will probably have to patiently wait for a period of time. [Furthermore//And] that period of time [might//could] still be very long and I don't think it's something [we//you//one/I] can do anything about.
If [we//you//one] [make//makes] the "symbol of a society's progress" a country's founding leaders being forgotten by their own citizens to the extent that they are "forgotten even by the common people", then, first of all, I think the Americans wouldn't be able to do it,
We cannot imagine that the Americans, for the sake of "social progress", would render Washington "forgotten even by the common people". America's capital would have to change its name. At least China doesn't have a "Mao Zedong City".
I think on the contrary that it's not whether Mao Zedong has been "forgotten even by the common people", but rather that certain people and certain powers are too anxious and too impatient. Each time September 9 comes around, they unaccountably fix their gaze on the "trend" in "China's official media" and then make a fuss over it,
Doesn't this illustrate perfectly that Mao Zedong can in no way be "forgotten even by the common people",
That's because those people who fervently hope that Mao Zedong will be "forgotten even by the common people" are forever unable to let go themselves,
Twenty-eight years after Mao Zedong died, some venerate him and some curse him,
Regardless of whether it is voices of eulogy or words uttered in curse, it all [shows//showed] that in the history of China Mao Zedong is a great man who cannot be forgotten. So what is this about being "forgotten even by the common people?"
