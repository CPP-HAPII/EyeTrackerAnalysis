In the past, China's wealth was entirely state assets or collective assets. It all belonged to the ordinary people.
In other words, when the "elite" first began to clamor for "reform", wealth was in the hands of the ordinary people and "reform" was in the hands of the "elite."
After reforms here and reforms there, the outcome [was//is] that wealth [had//has] fled into the hands of the "elite" and the foreigners. The ordinary people [were//are] left only with "reform", while the "elite" who [constituted//constitute] less than 10% of China [held//hold] more than 90% of the wealth.
No matter how the "elite" sugarcoated it, the fact [was//is] still a fact.
First-hand experience is more authoritative than any smooth talk.
As long as an ordinary Chinese's IQ is not the same as that of the house dogs of the jet set, they cannot possibly remained indifferent when faced with such reality.
If the "elite" want the ordinary people to have no opinion or bitterness over this, depriving the ordinary people of their "right of speech" [would//will] be useless, using "entitlement theory" to deprive the ordinary people of their right to thought [would//will] be useless, and "revealing the dagger at the end" by using politics, violence and suppression [would//will] be even more useless.
Reckoning all the options, it seems that the only thing to do is to eliminate the ordinary people's ability to perceive, causing the ordinary people to have absolutely no consciousness of any of the suffering. This might have solved the problem -- of course, this is the elite's "most ideal" solution.
As long as this day dream isn't realized, ordinary people will inevitably have their own assessment of all the facts, and it is unlikely that the "reforms" of the "elite" won't have a stink about them in the minds of ordinary people.
It [wasn't//isn't] that anybody [had//has] used language to give reform a "stink", but that the "elite" [had used//have used//used] action themselves to make themselves "stink" and make their "reform" stink.
