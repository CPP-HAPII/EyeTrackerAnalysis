Today, Singapore's Zaobao. com reporter Yu Zeyuan filed a report from Beijing -- "Chinese Official Media Silent on 28th Anniversary of Mao Zedong's Death",
The first characteristic seized by this fellow was that "yesterday was the 28th anniversary of the death of Mao Zedong, the founder of Communist China, but in official Chinese media, including television, newspapers, and websites, there were hardly any reports commemorating Mao. Many people had already forgotten or did not even know the death anniversary and birthday of this first-generation Chinese communist leader.
