[A song that just couldn't be any older//It is a song that just couldn't be any older].
Back in the days when band combinations were popular in Hong Kong, there was a band called [blue jeans//blue jeans, blue jeans].
[I've heard//I heard] some of their songs, and I don't like them much, for example, that very famous song, ["How Can It Be This Way."//"Outrageous"//'How Could Such A Thing Be Possible.'']
I, as a person, don't have much ambition, so when I listen to music, the best is purely to get away from reality, stuff like Utopia, the Garden of Eden, [fantasy//visionary] or sweet nothings is just fine. I definitely don't want any critiques on modern society's wrong practices.
So, even though I love Tat Ming Pair, their "Ten Young Firefighters," ah, and "In No Particular Order," ah, all of which aren't my taste.
[But then//Suddenly] one day I heard the song "Rainy Day," and couldn't believe that this was a Blue Jeans [song//product] where they lay down arms and turn romantic.
This feeling is like [BLUR's//BLUR door's] "TO THE END" or the Rolling Stones' "AS TERAS GOES BY."
They say a strong man who can show his emotions is a special treasure. Even if [it's not manly//he is overly affected], it's impossible to forget.
[You//We//One//People] [don't//does not] have to have a broken heart to go and listen to "Rainy day." There'll always be more of a market for sad songs; they have more power to hurt.
It's a hoarse voice very much like Lu Guanting's, it's very deep
