I used to feel bored of this kind of cultural gala already, especially the Spring Festival galas inside the country over the last few years. The awkward way they are slapped together, the lowbrow joke-making and the complexity instilled into the content have caused me to lose interest in entertainment galas, while my body's literary and art cells seem to be gradually dying off as well as my age advances.

Here I've only selected a few examples to share with everybody.
