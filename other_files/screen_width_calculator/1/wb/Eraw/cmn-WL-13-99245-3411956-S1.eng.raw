I left Chengdu with great excitement, accompanied by Xiao Zhao, my friend's driver.
Xiao Zhao is a Chengdu local resident, and [has often driven//often drives] visitors to Jiuzhai and Huanglong to tour on an average of over ten trips a year; [hence//and] he is very familiar with the routes and the environment.
The total distance between Chengdu and Jiuzhai is over 400 km, and it takes six to seven hours. To get there within a day would be too rushed and exhausting, and the body might not adjust well to the area's high altitude while touring Jiuzhai the next day.
If the trip is divided into two days, not only would it be much safer, there would also be more time to make brief stopovers at tourist spots and ancient towns along the way.
In Xiao Zhao's words, the process is also very important, ah?
Even though I wanted to reunite with my parents, who had already arrived in Jiuzhai earlier, I still accepted Xiao's careful arrangement with pleasure.
According to the plan, the first day's route was from Dujianyan to Wenchuan, and we stayed overnight in [Maoxian//Maoxian County].
We continued to forge ahead the next day, passing through Diexi Haizi, Mao'ergai, Songpan, and finally arrived at Jiuzhaigou and Huanglong scenic areas.
