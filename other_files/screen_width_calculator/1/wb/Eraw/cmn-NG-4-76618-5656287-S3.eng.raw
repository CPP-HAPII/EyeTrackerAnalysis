Tmac's problem [is//was] actually very simple, that is: don't be selfish, be motivated.
Yesterday KB shot 26 times, and he's just had a knee surgery this summer. Is he really not worried about getting injured again?
That is being unselfish, and that is being motivated.
Tmac gets the highest salary in the team, so he shouldn't care too much about himself. If he's like what he is doing right now -- neither willing to break through at the risk of being injured, nor willing to take the responsibility of the last shot on his own shoulders like a real leader of the team -- then we get the Tmac we've got now, and we might hate what's happened to him, but we're angry that he's not fighting back.
That 35-second [flash of brilliance//flash in pan] just [proves//proved] that he has the ability to create miracles. A real great star wants to keep on creating miracles, keep on breaking records, and keep on pushing the limits
