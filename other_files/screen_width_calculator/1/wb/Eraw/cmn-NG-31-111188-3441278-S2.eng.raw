There will be no competition and conflict between Ehack CRM and C3CRM. Ehack CRM will focus on a certain sector and try to do an in-depth and thorough job on a certain sector.
The operation model of the C3CRM afterwards also underwent changes. Our focus will be on the secondary development of the C3CRM, rather than providing technical support and services for customers.
[In the secondary development//In the two developments], if we find the added functions for customers can meet the needs of most companies, we will add the functions to the C3CRM and release them free of charge,
In addition, we welcome more companies and developers to do development on the C3CRM. If they'd like to share, they can also integrate the developed items and release them on C3CRM.
Next, we will gradually release some development files to help more people do development on the C3CRM.
Ehack CRM is available in a single company version and a multi-company version. The single-company version mainly targets one company. The multi-company version mainly targets the companies that provide the lease of CRM such as the numerous IDC companies in the country.
Companies interested in Ehack CRM are welcome to contact us for business cooperation.
