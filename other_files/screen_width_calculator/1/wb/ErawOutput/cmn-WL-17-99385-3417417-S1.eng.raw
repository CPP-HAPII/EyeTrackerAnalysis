More than half of the UEFA Champions League games have already taken place, and basically many strong teams are guaranteed access to the elimination series. Although the focus of this round is on the match between Basa and Chelsea, there is little doubt that they would jointly enter the [quarter-finals//16 strong teams]. But the situation is very complicated in Group B; if Bayern does its best and judging by their abilities, they should entirely demolish the Sporting Lisbon. Internazionale Milan [has lost//lost] the previous two matches to the opponents, but now they [have finally began//finally began] to explode; it remains to be seen if such an explosion would be too late. On the 4th day of the matches, Internazionale Milan [would//will] be in freezing-cold Moscow; Spartak is the only team that uses artificial turf, and it will be a great test for the Internazionale Milan. [Inter Milan//The Red and Black Army] [is//will be] without its four key players, Cambiasso, Recoba, Adriano, and Vieira. With the absence of these four players, it is estimated that Internazionale Milan [might//will//would//could] be significantly affected. If they cannot score three points in this match, their mission of acquiring the championship basically [comes//will come] to an end. There are some other games where the outcomes are fairly certain from my point of view. Both the English Super and Italy's Serie A have their advantages to some extent; but Italy's Serie A [play//will play] two games within a week, and this [would//will] put their physical abilities to the test. Especially for the Internazionale Milan, who exerted tremendous effort in trying to win the big game against AC Milan in the Derby [war//games]; now they must be mentally and physically exhausted after they arrived in Moscow
