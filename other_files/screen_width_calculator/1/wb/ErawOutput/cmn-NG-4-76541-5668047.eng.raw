Also Speaking a Word for the Main Theme of the State Administration of Radio Film and Television. Recently, at the annual meeting of the Capital TV Program Production Association, a person in charge from the State Administration of Radio Film and Television put forward requirements for this year's TV drama market: "The quantity of TV dramas produced should be controlled, with the slogan of the year of quality for TV dramas being proposed. There will be certain requirements on prime time programs on satellite channels across the country, which is programs at various places should primarily revolve around the main theme." Once the news is released, it aroused a debate on the Internet. The focuses of the debate are: the requirement of the State Administration of Radio Film and Television that various places should broadcast TV dramas revolving around the main theme is a restriction on the freedom of radio and television, as well as interference with public entertainment orientation using the administrative power; what on earth are the subjects that belong to the main theme, and what the main theme should represent. Currently, the programs of many TV channels are increasingly vulgar, and there are poor taste entertainment programs, such as variety shows and competition shows, that come one after another like following the trend; the screen is saturated with pornography, violence and murders in TV dramas; Kong Fu dramas are recast one after another, dramas about feudal royal families and anecdotes are absurd and far-fetched, and Hong Kong and Taiwanese romantic dramas are characterized by weeping and arguing. Can the voluminous broadcast of such TV dramas on TV channels bring pleasant visual enjoyment and spiritual nurture to viewers? The result could only be huge waste of human and financial resources, as well as destruction of environmental resources. Looking back on some excellent TV dramas shown in recent years, for example: military TV dramas including Long March, the Eight Route Army and Drawing Sword, and modern-theme TV dramas that reflect rural reform, kinship and friendship including Hometown, My Family Tree and Mother, are much popular among viewers. Now, at the mentioning of the main theme, people tend to equalize only those about revolutions and history to the main theme. As a matter of fact, the main theme is reflected in different aspects of society. For example: those that reflect the socialist ideological and ethical progress and the democratic and legal progress; those that encourage and motivate people to work hard and innovate for the national prosperity, people's happiness and social advancement; those that help people to tell right from wrong, insisting on anything true, kind and beautiful and resisting anything fake, evil and ugly; and those that depict national unification, ethnic solidarity, pleasant people, and stable society and politics etc. are what the main theme represents. It does not follow that the main theme would be eulogizing a specific political party or group. It is fundamentally decided by people's value orientation, where main theme is what people welcome and people like. I believe the regulation released by the State Administration of Radio Film and Television is appropriate and at the right time, in that it will help to prevent the degradation of the current TV programs, advocate good social atmosphere and right values among people, and establish a correct direction of public opinion. -- * Source:·BBS Unknown Space http://mitbbs.com·[FROM: 0.0.] . <POSTER> goodegg Poster: goodegg (Which came first, the eggs or the chicks?

Look at those so-called blockbuster movies these years, such as The Promise, Curse of... and The Banquet, plus the TV dramas like a pile of rubbish. Look at the response among people of the two-million yuan Crazy Stone, as well as the Silent Witness that boasts no famous director or cast. The art should originally come from the reality. I support the view of the State Administration of Radio Film and Television. Let those big-shot directors rest aside and my strong support for those TV dramas close to reality and life, good ones like the Silent Witness and Vertical Strike.
