At first, I signed up for a blog on DONEWS, thinking that it was a site for IT professionals where I could perhaps find friends more easily.Later, I signed up for another one on MSN, feeling that writing on MSN might make it easier for me to communicate directly with my MSN pals.But gradually, I discovered that both sites were not very good.At that time, DONEWS did not have the function of tallying traffic statistics (I have the habit of looking at the statistics of everything); and even though MSN [had//has] that function, others needed to sign on to MSN before they could reply, this meant that after reading the entries, many could not reply even if they wanted to, hence largely reducing the interactive element.The enthusiasm with writing the blog at the beginning [was short-lived//was short-lived as if it only lasted for 3 minutes]; after writing a few original articles for promotion, I did not continue anymore.At that time, I didn't think about posting articles from other sites as I felt that there was no need to post any articles if I could not come up with anything original; this meant that sometimes for over two months I didn't even update a new entry.Later, there were also some minor problems with both MSN and DONEWS, so I became more unwilling to post new articles.So, these two blogs have not really been very popular, either
