A high school teacher teaching chemistry in the United Kingdom [has appealed//appealed] to the Department of Education to allow the views and theories [that God created everything and intellectual life created the world//of creationism and intelligent design] to be introduced into school to be taught to students together along with Darwin's theory of evolution, which has been dominating the scientific community since the 19th century, and let students judge between right and wrong for themselves.The long-standing policy of British Department of Education has been that the theories such as God's creation are "unsuitable" for primary and secondary education.[Critics//The critic] [have pointed//has pointed//points//point] out that some scholars from non-English countries actually have long mistranslated evolution theory and misinterpreted Darwin's original intent, and the translation itself has a natural development from low to high level, a [falsehood//mistake] with almost religious bearings.Also some Western scholars - such as paleontologists and archaeologists from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany in the 19th and 20th centuries - have long made use of the distorted theory of evolution and social Darwinism derived from the argument to attempt to prove [their point//the view] that certain races are more advanced than others.
