To BPM (Jiaqi) (Jellied bean curd) and Others Who Find Fault with Country People <POSTER> damit There is no problem discussing the cy incident, but don't expand the target to country people. Don't think you are superior simply because you grew up in a city. You were not educated in a countryside environment, but the fact you could have made such uncivilized remark shows that your education background was not that good either. I attended college and knew people from the countryside as well as from cities. I myself grew up in the countryside. During each school vacation, most children in the countryside have to go back home to help with farm work. Their life is typically toiling on the land. At such times, what do you city kids do? +Killing time in bars, playing video games, hanging around with girl friends, sightseeing trips, etc. Children in the countryside know the hardship of life profoundly, and know their opportunity of attending school in cities are all obtained through their parents' hard work. So we especially treasure this opportunity and will not waste our time. So if you know nothing about the countryside in China, you'd better be careful when you talk about country people. I will not make further comment on your character since someone has already commented on it in their posts in response to your post. -- * Source: mitbbs.com BBS, http://mitbbs.com [FROM: 70.239.] <POSTER> lolo Poster: lolo (lolo), Board: Overseas //NOD, if one cy can represent country people, this logic is also extremely ridiculous. 【In the contribution by damit (cleveland), it was mentioned:】 : There is no problem discussing the cy incident, but don't expand the target to country people.
