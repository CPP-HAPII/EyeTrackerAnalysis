About the Relationship Between Patriotism and Going Abroad. <POSTER> A14062 Does it mean that one should not go abroad if he or she is patriotic? -- Of course not. Some aim to better build his/her own motherland, learning as much advanced knowledge abroad as possible, so as to offset their weaknesses with strengths and serve their own motherland better and more. I don't know how many people pursue their education with this concept in mind, but I think there should be some. However, quite a few people go for fame and gain. I do not actually oppose others seeking for what they think happiness is, and it is fine for some people to live their own life and it is fine for them not to contribute to their own country after going abroad, but they would not stop slandering China in various ways, which is extremely unacceptable. Does one have to go abroad to study advanced stuff? -- Of course not. Space is no longer a problem in the information society of today. You can find many things you need. The development of foreign countries are the result of the toils of their own people. Those who reap where they have not sown would be looked down upon wherever they go. Happiness is a feeling. The sense of happiness of overseas Chinese comes from their comparison with those in China. The most common are cars and also houses. Given the fact that everyone has a car in a foreign country, one cannot feel happy for owning a car. They are inferior in everything else compared with foreigners. What happiness? They are simply the underprivileged. Then he has no choice but to yell how happy he is among Chinese everyday. In the end, the Chinese should follow their own road without waiting, relying or complaining. Drastic steps should be taken to train, retain and attract talents. The way to retain talents and attract talents could be the sense of national responsibility and certain economic measures. Vigorously fostering a public opinion environment where going abroad and immigration are humiliating will benefit both the nation and its people greatly. -- * Source:路BBS Unknown Space http://mitbbs.com路[FROM: 24.52.]. <POSTER> ppww Poster: ppww (happy birthday), Area: ChinaNews.

Those going abroad without coming back are obviously not patriotic. They are at the most not loving or hating. Those being critical about China obviously are not necessarily unpatriotic, rather they are most likely out of concern, because after all it is their own motherland. Practically none of your views are right. [In the master piece of A14062 (the nomad group), it is mentioned:] : Does it mean that one should not go abroad if he or she is patriotic? Of course not.
