The Death of Ethnic Chinese Soldier Sun Ming, Hoping It is the Last [Original] <POSTER> Jerry0803 The Death of Ethnic Chinese Soldier Sun Ming, Hoping It is the Last [Original] A Chinese national fell on the Iraqi battlefield after joining the US military force. His name is -- Sun Ming. The US Army gave him very high honor: the Purple Heart, Bronze Star medal that symbolizes the highest honor. The Purple Heart, Bronze Star is the highest honor awarded by the Defense Department next to the Medal of Honor and the Silver Star. The former is awarded to courageous fighters, while the latter is only awarded to soldiers who are injured or fall in war. At the same time, a certificate that grants Sun Ming the US citizenship was also handed solemnly to Sun Ming's parents. This should be the prizes from the US government. In Serving the People, the obituary of Comrade Zhang Side, Mao Zedong said: "when people die in the village, a memorial service should be held to express our deep grief in this way." The same is true. No matter which country Sun Ming served, he was still a well-behaved Chinese citizen at the moment of his death. I express my sorrow for his death and my sincere condolence to his family: please accept my sincere condolences. What I want to say now is the significance and value of Sun Ming's death. Before we figure out this question, we must clarify whether the nature of the Iraqi War is righteous or not? If it is righteous, then the death of Sun Ming is significant, no matter to the United States, to China and even to the people all over the world. He then is an internationalist warrior like Bethune who should be remembered by the entire human kind. On the contrary, if the Iraqi War is not righteous, then the death of Sun Ming is not honorable at all. It is even not worthwhile or regrettable. As far as the International Law is concerned, any war unauthorized by the United Nations is disputable in terms of its righteousness. The honorable title is not widely recognized for those who fall in the war. Simply put, there would be two possibilities if it is included in the textbooks. One is the country waging the war would depict him as a hero for later generations to revere; The other is the country forced into war would regard him as a negative character for later generations to revile. It is well known there are two the Iraqi wars. One is the 1991 Iraqi War, which was sanctioned by the United Nations and represented the punishment by righteous forces around the world on Iraqi invasion into the sovereign country Kuwait. Without doubt, that Iraqi War was righteous in nature. Obviously, any soldier on the righteous side who sacrificed his life in this war, their death was meaningful to the world. However, the second Iraqi War, the Iraqi War still going on, is done by the United States leaving the United Nations aside. This is the reason why the war cannot be righteous in nature, no matter which countries or people believe Iraq should be beaten up, because emotions cannot represent the law. This is just like an unpardonably wicked villain. No one group or individual has the right to sentence him to death except the judge. If anyone has an itch and decides for the judge, the guy would be a manslaughter. I believe those who love "America" will not call me a sucker for comparing them this way. The United States is a very charming country. When a Chinese citizen devoted his life to American interests, it gave him the treatment of a US citizen generously. Sun Ming, whose biggest wish had been becoming a US citizen, can now close his eyes if he is still conscious in grave. But I have some other different thoughts. Now that the dead is gone, we should care more about the alive. For example shouldn't the US government do something for the bereaved families of "martyr" Sun Ming. Simply put, anyway it has to give a token of affection, right? It can just send them away with a "Certificate of Martyr" and some consolation money. Especially the words of Sun Ming's father "I hope the war ends as soon as possible, I hope the Bush administration ensures the safety of American soldiers. Don't hurt any families any more." Shouldn't the US government consider it seriously? Life is precious, and the United States is a nation that loves life and cherishes life. If it yells nothing is more valuable than life on the one hand, and it sends US soldiers across the world to bleed and sacrifice on the other hand, wouldn't the two be self-contradictory? How can it say it loves life and cherishes life? The US government says they have sent troops to Iraq to free the Iraqi people. With mountains and waters between us, I do not know the attitude of the Iraqi people and thus cannot judge groundlessly. But subconsciously I have a feeling that it is nothing more than a fight between two gangster heads for turfs. The Bush administration is the Water Margin, which holds up the flag of "acting for the god" without the authorization of Zhao Jie, destructing Zhujia Village today and eliminating Zengtou City the next day, and it is hard to say if it is attacking Daming City the day after. The Saddam regime are the likes of Tian Hu and Wang Qing. The public resentment cannot be dispelled if they are not killed. Isn't the death of Sun Ming the same as the deaths of Wen Zhongrong and Cui Ye. Tang Bin, Wei Zhongrong and Cui Ye were all former subordinates to Tian Hu. He wailed loudly as they were companions, while Song Jiang was merely miserable. On the contrary, let's see what Song Jiang looked like when his brothers died. In Chapter 112 of Water Margin, it says: "Mo Shan killed "White Faced Squire" Zheng Tiantao, and the two hit by poisonous arrows were "Dagger Devil" Cao Zheng and "Living Pluto's Wife" Wang Dingliu.Hearing three more brothers were lost, Song Jiang let out a cry and collapsed onto the ground. It is not sure how his five organs were, but his limbs were not moving." As the proverb goes some relatives are close but some are distant, and some people are close and but some are estranged. Another goes while it is not pitiful to die, it is pitiful not to die for the right thing. How sad Sun Ming, just over 20, sunshine, smiles, pimples and a life like the morning rays, disappeared unexpectedly with an evil bullet.Any love, beautiful love, my wretched child -- have you, ever experienced?Amen--.All relies:* A reminder: China was against the United Nations in Chinese-Indian, Chinese-Vietnam, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea - concentrated sulphuric acid (0 bytes) 2/01 /07 (1).o One is dragging the United Nations to attack others~ one is resisting the United Nations to attack itself ~ it seems - Light (0 bytes) 2/01/07 (0).* Leaving aside the political factors, the silly guy was too careless about his life!! - Xixihahahehe (0 bytes) 2/01/07 (0).* Thinking about the mine disasters happening in China practically everyday, aren't the miners killed and injured even more wretched than Sun Ming? - No life is paid if someone is exasperated to death (0 bytes) 2/01/07 (0). * It is fine as long as he doesn't help the US fight against China, otherwise his ancestral grave would be smoking - schakalhund (0 bytes) 2/01/07 (0).* Hope all Chinese citizens wishing to migrate to the United States join the army as soon as possible - J,Yu (0 bytes) 2/01/07 (0).* It seems there's not much to discuss??? - Runaway (0 bytes) 2/01/07 (0).* One remark: mission impossible - not a word (0 bytes) 2/01/07 (0).* The US government has granted US citizenship to about 60 immigrant soldiers who fell in Iraq - not a word (0 bytes) 2/01/07 (0).* There are over 40,000 non-citizen soldiers on active or reserve duty in the US - not a word (0 bytes) 2/01/07 ( 1).o Each year, there are nearly 8,000 permanent residents among soldiers on active duty - not a word (0 bytes) 2/ 01/07 (0).* There are over 40,000 non-citizen soldiers on active or reserve duty in the US - not a word (0 bytes) 2/01/07 ( 0).--▲ To realize the modernization in agriculture, industry, national defense and science and technology and build our motherland into a strong socialist country, the key is realizing the modernization of science and technology.▲ Economic construction and cultural construction are just like two wheels of a car that complement each other. ▲ Under the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and equality and mutual benefit, countries of different social systems can coexist peacefully.▲ The people's democratic dictatorship is an administration of the united people's democratic front under the leadership of the Communist Party, which should attach greater importance to the issue of the united front.▲ We should not only treat each ethnic group equally, but also enable us all to prosper.
