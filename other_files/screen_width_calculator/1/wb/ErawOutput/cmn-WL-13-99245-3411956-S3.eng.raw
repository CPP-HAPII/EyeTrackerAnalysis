Very soon it was noontime, and [young//Xiao] Zhao parked his car in the rest area of the gas station,Next to it was a Pangpang Restaurant: "The food here's not bad, we always come here for lunch. [I also know the boss well//The boss knows us well]."I let [young//Xiao] Zhao be our host and order some real farmhouse dishes.But when the dishes came, I was knocked out.Wild mushrooms fried with duck. The taste was definitely out of the ordinary, the flavor of the wild mushrooms as it went into [your//our//one's] [mouth//mouths] was unforgettable.For the locally famous Lian Mountain double-cooked pork, this big chunk of it was enough to fill [me//everybody//us] up.I like shredded pork in spicy sauce, [and//but] it was just a little too spicy.Spicy duck blood. [Young//Xiao] Zhao said, this was made with fresh duck's blood, not with duck blood powder.Eh? There's duck blood powder?It sounded very dangerous.This fresh spicy duck blood had texture that was a little springy and very tender. [But//And] it was just spicy, too spicy!Besides these four dishes, there was a plate of green vegetables, plus a big tureen of soup."It's too much, there's only us two, how are we going to eat this?" I asked [young//Xiao] Zhao as I looked at him in surprise.Several dishes, two bowls of rice and a tureen of soup all disappeared entirely after a few minutes of slurping![Young//Xiao] Zhao is a typical Sichuan man. He's not tall, quite skinny, but surprisingly, he really can eat.Okay, on this trip I am going to get some good food. The food tastes best when [you//we//one] [eat//eats] with a big eater.
