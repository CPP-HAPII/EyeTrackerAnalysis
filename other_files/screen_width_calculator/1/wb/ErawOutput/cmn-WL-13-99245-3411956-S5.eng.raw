Many of the yaks in the Tibet region are raised in the wild.Only when the Tibetans need money will they go into the mountains to catch a few to sell.Yaks [can//may] be very curious about outside visitors.In the time it took for [us//me] to get out of the vehicle and take a picture, the yak suddenly turned its head and started toward me.It startled [young//Xiao] Zhao, who screamed: Quick, get back in the car!Without waiting for me to close the car door, he put the car in reverse gear and backed up a hundred or so meters in a single sitting.We waited for the herd to leisurely cross the road, and climb a hillside before we continued to go on.It's true indeed, they are the landlords, and we were passers-by, so it was better to be polite.The source of the Minjiang River! [We//I] finally saw the source of the Minjiang River!Like with all great rivers, it is those tiny brooks hidden in the damp earth of groves and thickets that converge into the torrential Minjiang River that has nurtured generations of children in the vast lands [of Western Sichuan//to the west of the river].[Leaving//Saying goodbye to] the Minjiang River, the car arrived at high mountains and sheer ridges.
