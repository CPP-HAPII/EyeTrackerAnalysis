You should stand by your child. Re: I can only stand by the facts (forward) . <POSTER> Bcc 【 the following article was forwarded from Overseas Discussion Area 】 . I don't know what the best way to deal with your child is. Do you know? You're 20 years old; when you decided to have him, did you think you'd be going through this problem? If you're thinking only of this child, then you should use legal means as quickly as possible to resolve this problem. But what the law can resolve is only the issue of alimony. How do you plan on getting through the future? Will this child grow up in China or in the United States? If in the United States, how will you support yourself? How can you assure his livelihood? By relying on Professor Cui's alimony? By relying on government assistance? Even with both parents working, supporting a child is difficult. How can you assure this child's education, food and clothing? The child is blameless. Regardless of the reason that he came into this world, you can say that you struggled with all these difficulties for his benefit. But what did all this struggling get you? And what do you plan to struggle for? You and CY can't be together. Even if his wife divorces him, her two children will need alimony too. Of all that you struggle for, the only thing left may be a limited amount of money and this child's nationality. These things are far from enough to give him the happiness he needs. What he needs is a stable, warm home, a loving and not hostile environment, a mother at peace with herself. Whether you love CY or you hate him, it's a mistake. You should not let this mistake influence your judgment, a judgment about the future and welfare of your child. If you really loved him, then God has already granted you the fruit of this love; if you still bear animosity, then you should learn to forget that animosity in the warm expression in your child's eyes, and not contaminate his purity with your animosity. Ugliness is its own punishment. In court, you carry that child, looking for the man who loves him and loves you. I hope mother and child are in good health and happy. 【 in xiaojueniu (peace is happiness)'s article, this was mentioned:】 : : : I can't shield anyone, I can only stand by the facts, I can't commit perjury, Cui Yi did not negotiate with me, and now I have not : halted the legal proceeding. I only answered you to give them time to consider and prepare; I am only acting in my child's interests. : If Cui Yi does not accept responsibility and doesn't even make any good-faith acknowledgement of his mistake, then the legal process will go forward. A person should : behave with dignity, with moral integrity; nobody forgives people who want to cover up their mistakes. Toward your own flesh and blood, : someone who is so cruel, I can't let him go unpunished. Miss, if you can see these words of mine, I hope you can : contact me. I will answer you and do some things for you and your child, therefore I am waiting for you to show good faith. So many days have passed, I : haven't waited for anything at all. I am keeping my promise to you. This week is the last week I'll wait. My attorney has already : informed me that I cannot communicate with you again. But I want to trust you. Please don't disappoint me. I trust that you are a : good person and won't deceive me. If you are sincere, please have your attorney contact my attorney as soon as possible, OK? For the sake of my : child, I need to stand up and move ahead. : Please do not send me any probing letters from those friends who support Cui Yi; my child and I have already been : hurt a great deal. Please do not hurt us any more. My child and I have gone through a life and death struggle, and I have : suffered greatly. There is nothing wrong with my demanding that my child receive the rights he should have. You have your own parents and children, I hope : you can speak out of your own kindness. Everybody should stop dragging in Cui Yi's relatives and stop dragging in Miss TITI, : OK? Everybody care about me, please help me decide what is best for my child, thank you. : -- : : * Source:・BBS Unnamed space station http://mitbbs.com・[FROM: 203.86.] -- * Source:・BBS Unnamed space station mitbbs.com・[FROM: 32.97.] .
