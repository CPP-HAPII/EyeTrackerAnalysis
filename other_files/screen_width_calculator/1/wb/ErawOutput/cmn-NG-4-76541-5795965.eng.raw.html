Following the above "joke," "the effectiveness" of "the missile defense system" that the US used to effectively neutralize the "Chinese and Russian" nuclear threat, relying heavily on its space satellite system, was once again suddenly turned into a "joke" by Chinese weapons. Because of this, the last fig-leaf of Washington's "absolute capacity" in East Asia, the Middle East and Europe to serve as the "military protector of Japan, Taiwanese separatists, Israel and Poland" has fallen away. Liu Jianchao's advice -- "for Japan, following the road of peace is in its most basic interests" -- was not spoken lightly. Obviously, given that the nuclear strike capacities of "China and Russia" both have the capacity to destroy the US; given that both "China and Russia" have announced that they "possess" the capacity to completely wreck the "missile defense system," the construction of which the US has dragged Japan and Poland into contributing funds for; if those countries or forces hope to rely on the nuclear protection of the US and are ready to take whatever they can get in a "China-Russia-US" conflict, they may have to watch out. Don't let everything you have get smashed to smithereens without getting anything good out of it. It is very clear that if "China, Russia or the US" really want to start an action for the sake of their own space within which they can strategically develop, then restrained by the reality of "nuclear destruction," they will most likely use their force against the "strategic pivots" of their enemies. The Americans' strategic pivots first off include Japan and Israel. Therefore, as for the Taiwan Strait issue, in the eyes of Eastday commentators, Liu Jianchao's advice a few days ago, that "for Japan, following the road of peace is in its most basic interests," was absolutely not spoken lightly. As soon as there is a change in the Taiwan Strait, as soon as China and the US have knocked out all of each other's military satellites, then in the East Asian airspace that is "even closer" to China, US aircraft carriers will have no way to get close for back-up, due to the threat from the attacks by China's long-distance conventional weapons. As a result for the F-22, which has "impressive" stealth capabilities against airborne phased-array radar, but "greatly reduced" stealth capabilities against China's land-based high power phased-array radar and high power long-wavelength radar; given that they will not be supported by satellite intelligence, will not be supported by EWR aircraft intelligence, given that the F-22 will be forced to turn on its own airborne radar to enter combat; given that all the airfields of the F-15 and F-16 squadrons of the "US and Japan" will be within the range of China's long-range armaments; faced with a large fleet of fighter planes made up of fighters such as the J-10s and J-11s with Beyond Visual Range air and sea strike capabilities, with land-based radar picking targets, carrying "pl-12" medium-range guided air-to-air missiles, highly maneuverable and with a large enough combat radius; as well as the J-8d and f, with their good high-altitude and high-speed features; how much real chance of victory is there? Particularly in tactical terms, China could surely forward deploy large numbers of unmanned reconnaissance vehicles with highly matured technology. This also means "extending" the "aerial reconnaissance platform" out ahead of their own squadrons, performing comprehensive search with optical and magnetic reconnaissance technology, conducting joint search and positioning with AWACS and ground-based radar systems, and directing J-10s, J-11s and J-8s to targets. This way in the airspace over the East China Sea and Taiwan Strait, it can definitely use geographical superiority to greatly restrict the stealth advantage of the F-22 and to magnify their numerical disadvantage. Obviously, given China's ability to "attack the intelligence chain," faced with China's mighty capacity for precision long-range strikes, unable to receive support from land or naval forces, as soon as they also lose the effective support of their advantageous military space reconnaissance satellites, in reality, the US air force and navy that rely heavily on space intelligence, with no superiority of numbers and far from its US homeland -- we don't think their chances of victory are great if they are fighting right next to China. If the US Tries This Trick, Can China Deal with it? In dealing with China, the US always likes to use its hard side -- its great military strength. This is very expensive, and is also very dangerous to itself (particularly if China uses force against Taiwan), and will not necessarily achieve the desired result. But if the US changes to another method of dealing with China, it might be much more effective. If the US wants to crush China, it should find out what China's biggest weakness is. This is the only way to really hit the spot. I personally think China's biggest weakness at the moment is "corruption." The problem of corruption arises in every country, but what's worrying is that in China today official corruption is too widespread. Even more worrying is the public's level of acceptance of corruption. With this weak point in mind, the key to crushing China does not lie in setting up however many bases around China or preparing however much world class weaponry. It just needs the US government to use half an aircraft carrier-worth of money to set up a fund, and secretly bribe China's key officials. It wouldn't look good for a government to undertake this kind of slimy activity. A company or individual could be asked to do it. Bribery targets: key officials in the central government, key officials in regional governments, general managers of large state owned enterprises, and elites. In addition, let their children go to school in the US and train them to be "top returned Chinese" that work for the US. In less than 20 years, see if China can still deal with it. This is the simplest and most effective technique for defeating one's enemy soldiers without fighting. -- Source: mitbbs.com BBS, http://mitbbs.com [FROM: 72.94]
