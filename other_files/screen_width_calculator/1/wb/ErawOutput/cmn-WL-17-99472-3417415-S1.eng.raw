My wife job-hopped from a Chinese-funded bank to a foreign-funded bank,Either in terms of her experience or her ability, my wife is not my match, and most of the time I am her professional teacher.Her only advantage is her foreign language. After all, she is an English major graduate.[Now that//This time] she joined a foreign-funded bank, her position and salary are both higher than mine,Many times I would tease her, saying that they had chosen her[, a seemingly qualified candidate, from a bunch of inferiors//like choosing the taller one from a bunch of short persons] ...My wife [would answer//also answered]: too bad my English is better than yours!?I couldn't argue with that, as English is my weakness.I have gone for numerous recruitment interviews for the foreign-funded banks in the past few years, and also have had some contacts with foreign-funded banks. My wife's situation might have been a puzzle for many foreign-funded banks' recruitment.It is inevitable for foreign-funded banks to deploy a strategy of [utilizing local talent//localization]. Although there is a lot of recruiting information from foreign-funded banks on the Internet every day, as a matter of fact, the satisfactory candidates that they can find are very few.
