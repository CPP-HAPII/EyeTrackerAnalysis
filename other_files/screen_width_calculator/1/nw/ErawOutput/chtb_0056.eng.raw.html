Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th, by reporter Jie Qin The 53 national new high level technology development zones of China are developing rapidly, resulting in a large group of new high level technology enterprises with flexible mechanisms, and quick response to the demands of the market economy and strong capabilities in technical innovation. The new high level technology development zones of China were brewed in the early 1980's.  By last year, the total annual income of technology, industry and trade of the new high level technology development zones of China reached 230 billion yuan, with a total profit and tax of 23.8 billion yuan and annual foreign exchange earned through exports up to 4.3 billion US dollars.  All grew by tens of times since their initial establishment.  Among them, a group of new high level technology pillar industries with fixed  scale took shape.  There were 405 enterprises with output value exceeding 100 million yuan and 42 large enterprises with output value of more than 1 billion yuan. In 1996, the research and developing investment of the enterprises of new high level technology development zones of China reached 6.235 billion yuan, accounting for 3.5 percent of the sales income of enterprise products.  More than 13,000 types of new high level technology products were developed and produced. In recent years, the new high level technology development zones of China have preliminarily established a management system and operation mechanism that suits the needs of the socialist market economy system and the development needs of new high level technology enterprises and links with international conventions.  Intermediary agents and service institutions in areas such as information, finance, law, assets assessment, property rights, etc., have been established and continually perfected, preliminarily forming a relatively perfect support service decorum that suits the development of new high level technology enterprises. In order to regulate the management of new high level zones and to manage the zones legally, China issued the "provisional methods of managing national new high level technology industry development zones".  At the same time, new high level zones of Changchun, Suzhou, Shenyang, Changsha, Shijiazhuang, Kunming, etc. have either successively completed the State Council legislative works of new high level zones or issued management methods of new high level zones in the form of government orders.
