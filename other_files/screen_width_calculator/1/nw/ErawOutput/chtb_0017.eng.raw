Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 29th A few days ago, the National Development Bank successfully issued 30 billion yen of samurai bonds to Japan's capital market. This is the first time that the National Development Bank has issued bonds on the international capital market, with Japan Nomura Securities Corp. and the Industrial Bank of Japan Securities Corp. being the main co-issuers, and having a maturation time of ten years with a lump sum payment at maturation. According to investigations, the conditions for this issuing of samurai bonds have been fairly preferential in recent years.  The funds raised will be used mainly for key national construction projects, such as the Guangdong Ling'ao Nuclear Power Project, Yimin Electric Power Plant, Suizhong Electric Power Plant, etc. Since its establishment, the National Development Bank has raised large quantities of capital for key national construction projects. In 1995, the National Development Bank successfully organized 50 million US dollars in loans from foreign syndicates for the first time, and at the same time, undertook the transfer of foreign export credit for the projects such as the Ling'ao Nuclear Power Project and the second phase of the Qinshan Nuclear Power, etc.  From the aspect of both national capital and foreign capital, it continually increases support for key construction projects and has played an active role in promoting China's economic development.
