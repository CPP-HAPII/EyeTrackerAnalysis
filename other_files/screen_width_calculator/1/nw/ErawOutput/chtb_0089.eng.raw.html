Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 30th, by reporter Lianye Zhang At next Spring's "'98 negotiation conference on cooperation between east and west China and investment and trade", Shaanxi Province will promote public auctioning of a number of small state-owned enterprises to domestic and overseas traveling merchants. This province has currently drafted preferential policies to encourage state-owned enterprises, collective enterprises, privately-operated enterprises, individually-owned science and technology enterprises, foreign funded enterprises and average people from inside and outside the province using various methods to participate in Shaanxi's small state-owned enterprise reforms. It encourages small State-owned enterprises to cross industries, to cross regions and to cross ownership systems to look for co-operation partners and to proactively "become related by marriage" with dominant enterprises and to mutually merge.  Small state-owned enterprises of Shaanxi account for over ninety percent of the total number of state-owned enterprises, with fixed assets accounting for more than thirty percent, and the number of employees accounting for over fifty percent of the total number.  Shaanxi Province states that next year it will basically give more freedom to provincial small state-owned enterprises to do business.  Recently issued preferential policies include: appropriate preferences should be granted to enterprises with net assets and relatively good operations, where enterprise assets are sold to lawyers and average people; for those implementing auctions, related taxes can be reduced or eliminated; for those implementing shares cooperation system reforms, the state-owned net assets should be first sold to employees of these enterprises.  Income from transferring enterprise property rights should not only be used for settling employees, but also should be collected for re-investment. Through evaluation, enterprises whose assets and debt are quite balanced will implement a "zero assets" sale and debt will go with the assets.  If sold to employees, the form of these enterprise's ownership system and employee status will be changed at the same time.  If sold to a legal person or an ordinary person who accepts settling employees, the cost of buying seniority of state-owned employees, can be resolved by adopting the method of reducing or eliminating local taxes.  If not settling employees, the cost of buying seniority will be paid from the sale income of the state-owned net assets according to the financial affiliation relationship. For enterprises whose assets do not offset debt and that are on the verge of bankruptcy, measures can be adopted for reorganization such as reorganizing enterprise management levels, changing methods of enterprise assets operation, and guiding the enterprise organization of structural adjustment, etc.  For enterprises with no hope of revival, bankruptcy must resolutely be implemented according to law.  At bankruptcy, income from liquidating assets should be used first to settle employees and insufficiencies should be made up for from the sale of real estate. Stock cooperatives are an important form of opening up small state-owned enterprises.  Enterprises whose system is changed in this form can enjoy preferential policies, such as income taxes being returned when they exceed the base, temporarily not levying business tax on fixed assets, etc.  For those implementing mergers, the merging party can enjoy policy-type loss subsidies of the merged enterprise, or the enterprise accumulation fund can also be used to compensate for loss, and insufficiencies can be listed as pre-tax expenditures.  Non-bank debt of reformed enterprises can be transferred from creditor rights to stock ownership; those having difficulty paying taxes, can implement "temporarily postponing old debt but not owing on new taxes, and suspending taxes and waiving fines, and paying off year by year".
