Henceforth, the number of branch institutions of foreign banks and insurance companies in China would also suitably increase, and at the same time would also prepare to expand experimentation of foreign banks handling RMB business. At the same time, he also emphasized that, henceforth, more careful management of conditions of foreign financial institutions' applications to operate business in China and qualifications of senior staff, and the legality of their businesses would be implemented.
