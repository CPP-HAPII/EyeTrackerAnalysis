What kind of memory? We respectfully invite you to watch a special edition of Across China. WW II Landmarks on the Great Earth of China: Eternal Memories of Taihang Mountain  Standing tall on Taihang Mountain is the Monument to the Hundred Regiments Offensive. It is composed of a primary stele, secondary steles, a huge round sculpture and beacon tower, and the Great Wall, among other things. A primary stele, three secondary steles, and two inscribed steles. The Hundred Regiments Offensive was the campaign of the largest scale launched by the Eighth Route Army during the War of Resistance against Japan. This campaign broke through the Japanese army's blockade to reach base areas behind enemy lines, stirring up anti-Japanese spirit throughout the nation and influencing the situation of the anti-fascist war of the people worldwide.  This is Zhuanbi Village, Wuxiang County of Shanxi Province, where the Eighth Route Army was headquartered back then. On a wall outside the headquarters we found a map. This map was the Eighth Route Army's depiction of the Mediterranean Sea situation at that time. This map reflected the European battlefield situation. In 1940, the German army invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. It was during this year that the Japanese army developed a strategy to rapidly force the Chinese people into submission by the end of 1940. In May, the Japanese army launched ... From one side, it seized an important city in China called Yichang. Um, Yichang, uh, through Yichang, it could directly reach Chongqing. Ah, that threatened Chongqing. Then they would, ah, (()) bomb these large rear areas such as Chongqing. So, along with the coordinated, er, economic blockade, military offensives, and strategic bombings, er, a simultaneous attack was launched in Hong Kong to lure the KMT government into surrender. The progress of this coordinated offensive was already very entrenched by then. By 1940, China's War of Resistance against Japan had entered a stalemate. The situation on our side and the enemy's side was intertwined. The Eighth Route Army guerrillas were extraordinarily active, creating more and more trouble for the Japanese army in North China. Hayao Tada, commander of the Japanese North China Area Army, adopted a strategy of siege warfare to deal with the Eighth Route Army. The specific method was building a closely connected transport network, with a road for every village and defensive towers on every road. Roads and railways were used as links to connect all of North China into a solid, widespread siege, in order to strangle the Eighth Route Army and its base areas in this net. As part of the Japanese army's strategy of siege warfare, railways and roads had actually become the Japanese army's weapons of war, becoming a great threat to the base areas. In December 1939, Commander-in-chief Zhu De and Vice Commander Peng Dehuai of the Eighth Route Army received a top-secret telegram from Commander Lu Zhengcao of the Jizhong Military District, among other people. The telegram said that the Japanese troops were building blockade trenches and chessboard-like roads to divide the Jizhong base area into small isolated blocks without the ability to mutually communicate and support each other, causing the Eighth Route Army and the guerrillas to lose maneuverability. Before the Hundred Regiments Offensive in 1940, an inclination to compromise, ah, surrender, was an extremely serious crisis in the frontline ((situation)) in China. Well, on the battlefield behind enemy lines, in order to take over, consolidate the area under its occupation, Japan began a new strategy. That was to use railways as a pillar, roads as a chain, and strongholds as a lock, to carry out siege warfare in an attempt to divide the base areas behind enemy lines, ah, so as, er, to cut off their communication with one another. In addition, it relied on this cage, ah, to further strengthen its assaults against the base areas. Er. So, it was amidst such a grave international and domestic situation that the Eighth Route Army led by the Chinese Communist Party, ah, launched, ah, a strategic offensive called the Hundred Regiments Offensive. This plot of the Japanese army drew great attention from Zhu De and Peng Dehuai of Eighth Route Army headquarters. After meticulous studies and painstaking preparations by many parties, a battle plan based on surprise was formulated. On July 22, 1940, a campaign preparation order to attack the Zhengtai Railway, jointly signed by Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and Zuo Quan, was sent to Yan'an and all units of the Eighth Route Army. What was the purpose, purpose and goal of this campaign? It was to break through the Japanese army's siege policy against base areas behind enemy lines, and to avert the crisis of China's compromise and surrender. It was to overcome this crisis. Well, the Hundred Regiments Offensive was divided into three phases. Beginning from August 20, from August 20 to September 10, the main purpose of the campaign was to sabotage the Zhengtai Railway. The Zhengtai Railway started from Zhengding, Hebei in the east and ended in Taiyuan in the west, with a total length of 243 kilometers traversing the Taihang Mountain range. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the Zhengtai Railway was a key strategic transportation line for the Japanese army in North China. It was also one of the major blockade lines for causing destruction to anti-Japanese base areas. Along this railway line was the Niangziguan Pass, a natural barrier, and the Jingjing coalmine, a key fuel base in Yangquan for the Japanese military in North China. Outside of Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang, the Japanese military deployed the 4th, 8th, and 93rd mixed brigades and regiments, which were scattered among 50 strongholds along the railway line. The situation was getting worse and worse for the Eighth Route Army and the anti-Japanese areas behind enemy lines. Actions had to be taken to break through the blockade. On a night in late July 1940, the atmosphere in Zhuanbi Village in Shaanxi was unusual. Villager Xiao Jianghe has a vivid memory of this piece of history. On that dark night, everyone was sleeping when human voices and neighing horses were heard within the village. People all got up. Did something (()) happen? Some folks got up. (()) Opening the street gate, they saw a soldier standing by the gate. Folks, go back, go back, nothing is wrong. Our troops are just going to stay here for the night. Don't say you are scared. Our commander is coming. I am telling you to go back to %pw sleep peacefully. Ah, so we went back to sleep. Ah, why should you come out if you were told not to? By the time we got up early the following morning, the sports ground in Zhuanbi Village was packed with soldiers who had stationed there. Essentially the entire enemy had been destroyed. It was an arduous battle. (()) At 10:00 p.m. on August 20, 1940, various units of the Eighth Route Army launched a full-scale offensive according to the general plan. The head of the County People's Armed Forces Commission was named %pw Zhao Yemin. Zhao Yemin came, ah, bringing a group of armed personnel and some things. Upon arriving, he relayed an order, saying the road from Yangquan to Hedi must be cut off tonight, with the electrical wires slashed. He himself would bring these people, this group of people to blow up that Wudu bridge. %pw Led by Nie Rongzhen, the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Military District was ready for an offensive, while at the same time, fifteen regiments laid an ambush in advance along the Zhengtai Railway, launching fierce attacks on Japanese military strongholds along the railway line. It was also during the night of August 20 that the 129th Division directed by Division Commander Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping, with eight regiments, including two regiments of the 1st Dare-to-Die Corps and eight independent battalions, formed left-flank and right-flank commandos and a central contingent. On the night of August 20, offensives were launched against most of the Japanese independent 4th mixed brigade and part of the independent 9th mixed brigade along the western section of the Zhengtai Railway. Additionally, two regiments, together with local armed forces in places such as Pingding, Liaoxian, and Yushe, carried out sabotage on the Pingliao and Yuliao roads and pinned down the enemy at various points, ensuring safety of the main forces on the sides and rear. Current estimates are that this section was taken care of in less than four hours, three hours. After this was taken care of, four blockhouses were blown up. By digging tunnels, they charged out the center. Only then did they wipe out the enemy, wipe out the enemy. More than %pw two hundred enemy soldiers were eliminated in a single blow. It was still during this night that the 120th Division, directed by Division Commander He Long and Political Commissar Guan Xiangying, with 20 regiments, sabotaged the northern section of the Tongpu Railway and some main roads west of the railway. It also took over strongholds at Yangfangkou, Kangjiahui, and Fengrui Village, cutting off the northern section of the Tongpu railway and the roads from Xinxian to Jingle and Fenyang. In order to coordinate with breakthrough battles at the Zhengtai Railway and the northern section of the Tongpu Railway, the 129th Division and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Military District also ordered their units to deploy more than 50 regiments ((Yang to Lishi)) in cooperation with militias, to launch widespread sabotage and raids on the Pinghan, Pingsui, Beining, Baijin, Jinpu, and Deshi railway lines, among others, as well as some main roads and many strongholds occupied by the Japanese army.  On the afternoon of August 22, Peng Dehuai was listening to the combat operation director report on battle developments at Eighth Route Army operational headquarters. When asked about the actual combat strength of the Eighth Route Army, the combat operation director reported: There are 30 regiments along the Zhengtai Line, 15 regiments along the Lugou Bridge-Handan section of the Pinghan line, 12 regiments along the Datong-Hongdong section in Tonghu County, and four regiments along the Tianjin-Dezhou section of the Jinpu Line, with a total of 105 regiments entering the campaign. With a wave of his hand, Peng Dehuai said that despite being over 100 regiments, let's call this campaign the Hundred Regiments Offensive. That afternoon, Peng Dehuai first used the name Hundred Regiments Offensive in telegrams sent to various military corps and the Central Military Commission. A total of 105 regiments participated in the Hundred Regiments Offensive. Well, it was a force of more than 200,000 soldiers. In addition to that, er, no less than 400,000 militiamen, guerrillas, and civilians, er, voluntarily participated in the offensive. So, there were probably 600,000-plus soldiers and civilians. The Hundred Regiments Offensive dealt (()) a devastating blow to the enemy at Shi'nao Mountain. Our troops were strong, troops were strong. Er, and those in charge of logistics and support were able to follow in time. Er, our anti-Japanese vanguard team, er, the anti-Japanese vanguard team was composed of all young people in their 20s; all young people, all in their 20s, 20s.  This is Shi'nao Mountain, situated in Yangquan, Shanxi, a strategic passage of the Zhengtai Railway back then. On August 21, 1940, in order to pin down Japanese troops stationed in Yangquan and to cover for militiamen sabotaging the western section of the Zhengtai Railway, the 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army ordered the main regiment of its 385th Brigade, the 14th Regiment led by Brigade Commander Chen Xilian, to head directly for Shi'nao Mountain to seize the high ground. Like a sharp sword, civilians in the western section broke through the strategic passage. Frustrated and angry, the Japanese army immediately deployed a large number of troops in an attempt to retake Shi'nao Mountain. To the enemy's complete surprise, desolate Shi'nao Mountain had been turned into a strong combat fortress by our troops in less than a night. Like a lion with its mouth wide open, towering and rugged Shi'nao Mountain was constantly waiting for any invaders who dared come close. The night before, we destroyed the roads and cut off all electrical and railway lines, making it impossible for it to communicate. It did not know how many of us went to destroy the roads, whether it was the Eighth Route Army or not, the regulars, or others. It did not know, right? After all, its telephones had stopped working. Yeah, the roads had been cut off, with its vehicles unable to drive back and forth. The following seven days and nights were extremely tough. Starting from the 23rd, the Japanese army in Yangquan, backed by helicopters, launched nonstop fierce attacks on Shi'nao Mountain using chemical weapons. During the Shi'nao Mountain battle, our soldiers died in large numbers. So many died that the clean-up was done in batches. In addition, many people were poisoned when toxic gas was released. They were poisoned and did not know how to protect themselves against the poison. They simply crawled on the ground and wetted handkerchiefs in the rain to cover their noses against the poison. Eh, medics were quite busy. Several days of autumn rain turned the combat trenches extremely muddy. The Eighth Route Army officers and soldiers soaking in the muddy water fought their powerful enemy with utmost effort. With bombs exploding next to the trenches, they showed no fear at all. When their blood turned the yellow soil red, they applied iodine solution to their wounds and closed them with bandages. They wrapped them with bandages, and that was it. Under the powerful offensive of the Eighth Route Army, the enemy was only able to defend itself, without any strength to fight back. The battle proceeded very smoothly, with the initiative steadily in the grasp of the Eighth Route Army. Since the strategic objective of the Hundred Regiments Offensive was to smash the enemy's blockade of bases, it was of critical importance to destroy the roads and remove strongholds. The various units of the Eighth Route Army taking part in the battle wasted no time destroying the roads. They proposed not to leave behind a single rail, a single cross tie, a single railway station, a single blockhouse, a single bridge, or a single electricity pole. They mobilized and organized the masses and won over the railway staff, making great effort to destroy the railroad, the stations, and related facilities by means including dismantlement, explosion, fire, and water. I was in charge of this, er, and ... Er, er, due to this ... To cut off the electricity, er, considered a deputy commander-in-chief responsible for these electricity lines. He, I was responsible for this project, ah. The militiamen were divided into two groups. One was responsible only for cutting electrical wires, and the other for destroying roads. We people, ah, were under his command for the time being. We all took part in destroying roads. From the Zhengtai road, from, um, Zhengding to, um, Shijiazhuang, to Taiyuan, more than 400,000 civilians participated in destroying roads. Most important at that time along the Zhengtai road was mainly to destroy the Jinxi coal mine. Soldiers used hay cutters to sever the wire net, charging into the station and destroying the machine room and water tower, and then started to destroy the road. Of the three to four thousand civilians participating in the battle, one soldier was added to every squad of 16 people formed. While destroying roads, there was clear-cut division of labor. Some took off screws; some uprooted rail spikes; some knocked off joint bars; some removed cross ties; some carried away rails. For cutting electrical wires, the militiamen in the village were waiting for the troops to come, (()) Ah, Over there, a builder of the surrounding walls sabotaged transportation by pushing over his surrounding walls. It was built during the day, and at night, overnight militiamen shoveled it over. The task of the 72nd Regiment was, er, this destruction battle. This destruction battle went on for a day and a night. Each day the general situation was different. [[They attacked small bridges and small districts, and generally looted these stations.]] They carried away the iron, the iron rails of the railway, er to make steel. Er, for wood materials, local folks simply destroyed them by fire. In this way, they fought the battle while at the same time destroying roads, stripping the entire 60-li-long railway from Xingtai to Neiqiu within just a few days. In this way, a blockade line of steel regarded as a lifeline by the Japanese army was paralyzed. It was a very tough battle. The enemy attacked several times, and each time they were repelled. There were extremely heavy casualties. Overseas Japanese in Yangquan City were all mobilized to participate in the battle, including children of 15 to 16 years of age. They wanted to have (()), (()) overseas compatriots get together so that they could support one another in wiping out the Eighth Route Army and foiling our movement to destroy roads.  The Hundred Regiments Offensive lasted three and a half months and involved two major offensive phrases and one anti-sweep phase. During the first phase from August 20 to September 10, 1940, a general offensive was launched on major transportation lines such as the Zhengtai, Tongpu, Pinghai, and Jinfu lines with an emphasis on destroying the Zhengtai Railway. During the second phase from September 22 to early October, the mission was to continue expanding battle achievements, to destroy the flanks of transportation lines, and to penetrate puppet strongholds in anti-Japanese bases. During the third phrase from October 6 to December 4, the main task was to counterattack a retaliatory sweep by the Japanese army and puppet army. The Eighth Route Army smashed successive large-scale sweep operations launched by the Japanese army and puppet army against anti-Japanese bases in Taihang, Taiyue, Pingxi, Beiyue, and northwest areas of Shanxi, among others. To those who have never experienced wars, wars are vivid stories. To those who have experienced wars, war is the course of life, part of life. There are (()), At that time, the Hundred Regiments Offensive greatly encouraged the vast numbers of soldiers and civilians, with news of fighting spreading rapidly throughout the Taihang Mountain area.  Few of the veterans who participated in the Hundred Regiments Offensive are still alive. When they speak of the Hundred Regiments Offensive, they are always so excited. Everyone has their own memory, has the Hundred Regiments Offensive as their own memory. I was given five bullets; er, I got five bullets. I carried these five bullets with me in my pocket. I took them out for a look every day. Hey, this was my life. Hey, this was my life. I could not lose them. The squad leader said, at the time when you are given a rifle, you need to shoot. I will watch. If you fail to shoot the enemy, I will punish you when you come back. Do you know lice? They bite. How do you scald them? Hey, Well, you boil some water and get something like gunpowder. Then you loosen your pants and sprinkle it. Clench it like this. Then, you shake it, and you hear a cracking sound on the ground; hey, scalded lice. A washbasin was also very precious. How was the washbasin used? You used the washbasin to wash your feet, used the washbasin to hold your meal, used the washbasin to wash your face, and sometimes used the same washbasin to boil water. So, this washbasin was a precious washbasin. This photo taken back then by Eighth Route Army field correspondent Xu Xiaobing is a snapshot of Peng Dehuai directing the campaign at the frontline of the Hundred Regiments Offensive. Just as Mao Zedong once praised: "Who dares wield his sword and make his horse rear? Only our great General Peng." Correspondent Xu Xiaobing, covering frontline news at the time, snapped the shutter while artillery fire roared overhead. More than 60 years later, Xu Xiaobing still vividly remembers the scene at that time. Dehuai was sitting in this trench directing the campaign. Oh. Bullets and artillery fire whistled past his head. During the three and a half months from August 20 to December 5, 1940, the Eighth Route Army fought a total of 1,824 battles large and small. A total of 46,480 Japanese soldiers and puppet soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured, or defected. Four hundred seventy-four kilometers of railroad and 1,502 kilometers of highway were destroyed. In addition, large quantities of other military supplies were seized or destroyed. After the Eighth Route Army launched the Hundred Regiments Offensive, newspapers from areas behind enemy lines in North China to the large rear area continuously carried news of victories. Telegrams and letters of congratulation arrived in Yan'an from all directions.  Mao Zedong was deeply moved. This leader with a strong poetic temperament expressed his joy in this kind of telegram. The Hundred Regiments Offensive caused great excitement. Can such kind of campaign be organized once or twice more?  In a congratulatory telegram to Zhu De and Peng Dehuai, Chiang Kai-Shek praised the Eighth Route Army's resolute attacks for dealing a heavy blow to the enemy. By pinning down large numbers of Japanese soldiers on battlefields behind enemy lines in North China, the Hundred Regiments Offensive delayed the Japanese army's aggression southward. In addition, the Hundred Regiments Offensive was a response to the European battlefield, while enhancing the international reputation of the CPC and the Eighth Route Army. The Hundred Regiments Offensive wrote a glorious page in the history of China's War of Resistance against Japan. On June 30, 1987, the Monument to the Hundred Regiments Offensive was erected on Shi'nao Mountain in Yangquan, Shanxi, where the heroes had fought the battle. In 1993, six villagers in Honghecao Village set up the Hundred Regiments Offensive Museum at the place of Nie Rongzhen's operational command. Old Li Jingtang still tells visitors old war stories circulating in the Taihong Mountain area.  More than 60 years have passed since the Hundred Regiments Offensive took place. Taihang Mountain will forever remember that great battle during the Chinese people's War of Resistance against Japan.  During World War II, the two hundred thousand strong Chinese Expeditionary Force went abroad to fight. The Burma Road was the lifeline artery for China's anti-Japanese battlefields. The Tengchong Battle, an annihilation of the Japanese army, became a typical example for the China war area. We respectfully invite you to watch a bloody battle fought side-by-side by China, the US, and Britain 60 years ago in a joint effort to repel Japanese invaders.  Hello, everyone. This is Across the Strait on CCTV International Channel. We welcome you to watch. First, let's check out the main contents of today's program. On August 17, Taiwan's investigation department and police held a press conference announcing the closing of the March 19 shooting case. Since the suspect identified by Taiwan police mysteriously died after the March 19 shooting incident, the case was not prosecuted. However, people from various circles in Taiwan think there are many suspicious points in this case. On August 17, the Taiwan military held the Lianhsing 94 amphibious landing exercise, testing and enhancing the army's response capabilities and its combat ability in repelling an enemy's amphibious landing. Taiwan's investigation department and police announced the closing of the March 19 shooting case. Well, why did Taiwan's investigation department say this was the closing of the case instead of the actual truth about %pw the shooting case? Scholars will give you a detailed analysis on this edition of Hot Topic Analysis. On August 17, Taiwan's investigation department and police solved the case and announced the %pw March 19 shooting case was closed. This case will not be prosecuted.
