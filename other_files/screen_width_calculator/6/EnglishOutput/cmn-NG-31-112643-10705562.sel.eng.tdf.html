These grassroots cadres resisted State laws and Party policies. In addition, they served as the shield for criminal and underworld forces. The seriousness of the circumstances and the malice of the tricks had reached an extent that made one's blood boil. State laws and Party policies were not implemented. Grassroots leaders of Quanshan district Party and government departments abused their authorities to deceive their superiors and oppress their subordinates. They practiced fraud brazenly and covered up criminal offenses by force. The corruption had become so serious that ordinary people had no one to report the offenses to. Even if ordinary people used the law to seek justice, it would not work in Quanshan District, Xuzhou.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-112643-10705562	0	800.0	900.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Grassroots leaders of Party and government departments practiced fraud and covered up very obvious criminal offenses by force.
