It stipulates that labor contract has to be signed when hiring workers. However, it did not stir up such huge social debates. Meanwhile, the Labor Contract Law that came into effect in 2008 is only a clarification of the Labor Law and provides stipulations for some mandatory measures. Why does it have such huge +response?	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	900.0	1000.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Zhao Wei: It is closely related to the economic development of our country. The Labor Law was promulgated during the course of transition from planned economy to market economy in our country. Its objective is to "build and uphold labor system that suits Socialist market economy". The purpose of signing labor contract is to break with the practices of "having everybody eat from the same big pot" and lifetime employment and to increase labor efficiency.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	1400.0	1500.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Against the backdrop of general heightening of the awareness of rights protection of labors, such stipulation is obviously potent.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	1600.0	1700.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Puzzle answer number three: Is the Labor Contract Law the cause of the withdrawal of funds?	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	1700.0	1800.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	The fund withdrawal "crisis" in the Pearl River Delta had caused panic in some people. The "midnight escape" of more than 30 Korean-owned businesses in Shandong and the closedown of some labor-intensive businesses in Henan seemed to make people think that this "crisis" is spreading inland. Should we blame these all on the Labor Contract Law?	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	1800.0	1900.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Do the foreign-owned businesses that we introduced and some domestic small and medium-sized businesses all maintain operation by operating illegally and at low labor cost?	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	3400.0	3500.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	For instance, the stipulation for signing a labor contract, in the past, as long as the business did not want to use the workers, they could fire them at anytime because no labor contract was signed, but now, the business has to pay double the salary.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	4000.0	4100.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	When an open-ended labor contract is signed, is it true that the business cannot terminate the labor contract?	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	4400.0	4500.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	I believe that we cannot generalize this. We have to look at the foundation of the actual situation in the two countries.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	5100.0	5200.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Article 3 "negotiated consensus", Article 4 "determined after consultation on the basis of equality", and Article 43 "inform the labor union and the labor union shall have the right to request" of the law are to stipulate these rights.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	5700.0	5800.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Puzzle answer number five: Will the implementation of the Labor Contract Law increase labor cost of businesses?	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	6000.0	6100.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	This stipulation only involves part of the workers of the business. If implemented, it will be the equivalent of paying an extra month of salary for every full year of service.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	6300.0	6400.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	The purpose of increasing these two costs is to curb the wanton termination of contracts or abuse of probationary period by hiring units to extort cheap labor force and to establish stable labor relations.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	6700.0	6800.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Puzzle answer number six: Has the strong push of the Labor Contract Law restricted the room for voluntary choice of the labor and the management?	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10513026	0	8400.0	8500.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Facts have proved that from the opening of large number of subsidiary and collectively-owned businesses to resolve the employment problem of many intellectual youths who returned to the city in the beginning of the reform and opening up to the distribution of official documents to the lower levels to encourage development of self-employed and private economy and the reform to privatize many poorly-managed state-owned businesses, all these have resolved the employment problem of a large number of extra labor force in rural areas that the land is incapable of supporting and laid-off workers in the city. In today's world where the levels of computerization, mechanization, and automation continue to heighten, the danger of mass unemployment always exists. There is no doubt that helping and supporting small and medium-sized businesses to heighten their management level and production efficiency and reducing taxes and burden bore by these businesses in order to give these businesses confidence in long-term survival and development should be matters of prime importance that the government should attach great importance to.	0	0	0
