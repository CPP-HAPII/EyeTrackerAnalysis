The advantage is this group of people has a wealth of experience and can immediately get into a working mode, but sales people tend more to reference distributors' opinions in terms of their perspectives on problems as well as their consultation and analysis of data. Sometimes this will bring negative influence on the company's strategies.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117685-10718649	0	3300.0	3400.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	A product manager mainly persuades others by objective analysis, smart strategic design, and a large amount of literature. It would be absolutely perfect if he is a bit more eloquent and persuasive, but that's almost something you may come across by luck and not through seeking.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117685-10718649	0	3400.0	3500.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Therefore, the initial product manager's personality should be more introverted. He works in obscurity yet is ubiquitous. In addition, the personal conduct of the product manager is also very important. A lot of information must all be verified by sources from different channels, and you cannot make various easy judgments at will. However, since no standards and procedures have yet been formed regarding the working methodology of these matters, it is impossible to make timely judgments about the selection, analysis and conclusion of the information. The erroneous and careless information may mislead the company. Therefore, if the product manager is not working steadily and diligently enough, and often does his job based on assumptions, then it will have a very harmful influence on the development of the company. Such people are absolutely not suitable to be product managers.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117685-10718649	0	4000.0	4100.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Second, the marketing director works with a wider range of matters: his information comes from the analyses that the marketing division manager, sales manager and he himself have made. Therefore, he does not need to demand that the marketing division manager must do in accordance with what he has conceived. In fact the marketing director should encourage more the marketing division to put forward their own ideas so that he can verify the ideas of the sales manager.	0	0	0
