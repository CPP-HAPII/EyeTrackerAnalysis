Meanwhile, protesters were trying by all means to erase the CPC's "glory of a great nation," letting the entire world know that the CPC's is a despotic country that tramples on human rights amidst escalating social conflicts and extreme disharmony.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-112643-10467332	0	1500.0	1600.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	However, the momentum of the online petition was really not powerful enough. By 10:20 p.m. on April 7, the number of people participating in the signature drive was still 133,948. Compared with the huge population of one billion-plus in China in addition to the ethnic Chinese scattered across the world, this number was indeed a bit embarrassing.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-112643-10467332	0	1800.0	1900.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Why would this government trigger so much anger and condemnation?	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-112643-10467332	0	2000.0	2100.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	I cannot imagine that seeing the "pomp" of the Olympic torch relay conducted under the protection of strong police force, Chinese people would still believe such lies as those promoted by the authorities that "wherever the Olympic torch goes, it is warmly welcomed by the peoples of various countries around the world."	0	0	0
