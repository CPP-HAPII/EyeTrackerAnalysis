Its temporary (lets assume that in the future Nanjie village's wealth will "advance" into privatization) retreat into a collective economy, internal spreading of Mao Zedong thought, and occasional indulgence in "class struggles as center", ended up with success in all areas of the market economy. This also laid down an excellent base for producing a few billionaires after it "advances" into privatization in the future!	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-117651-10512822	0	5700.0	5800.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	I believe that Wu Jinglian can completely disregard attacks from the left wing, however serious academic criticism from a rightist like me cannot go unanswered; what we are doing here is a friendly academic inquiry within the right wing.	0	0	0
