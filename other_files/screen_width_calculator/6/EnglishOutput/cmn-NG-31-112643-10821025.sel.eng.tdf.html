At one point, the demonstration activities blocked the traffic on North Chaoyang Road for more than three hours. A large number of police officers were dispatched, and it was said that there were also incidents of assault.	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-112643-10821025	0	400.0	500.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	The cause for this happening was that there is a large waste treatment plant in the vicinity of Changying and Guanzhuang. The area is often permeated with a stench. Cancer-causing substances such as dioxin released from incineration in the waste incinerator were at a level more than forty times the normal one. Nearly a million people in the surrounding areas have been complaining about it for years but no government agency has given any explanation. Furthermore, the government is building millions of square meters of affordable housing and price-limited housing some 500-plus meters due south of the dumpground. I don't know whether the government had taken into consideration the health and safety of ordinary people at the grassroots level when making this decision?	0	0	0		cmn-NG-31-112643-10821025	0	500.0	600.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	The dumpground should not be built in the urban area. It cannot be furthermore built in the heavily populated area. Planning price-limited and affordable housing goes even more beyond comprehension!	0	0	0
