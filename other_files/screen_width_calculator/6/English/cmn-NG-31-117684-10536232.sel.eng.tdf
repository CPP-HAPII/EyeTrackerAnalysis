I hear that once again every countryman will be represented; strictly speaking, as a Chinese this kind of thing is as common as dirt, if you count television, newspapers and the Internet all together, the number of times we have been represented is just about the same as the number of breaths, however, this particular experience does have some exceptions: Those of us being represented actually have the possibility of getting our hands on U.S. dollars, very nice, very nice, this really can count as a bumper harvest for spiritual materialism.	0	0	0

I admire and fully support you, but please whatever you do, do not take in with you at the very least my intelligence -- For this reason, supposing in the case you win, I would rather go without the 1 U.S. dollar, because someone who can approve of logic as ridiculous as that is already not far from being an idiot, and if we use this inept method to steal a dollar from American taxpayers and then get all smug and complacent -- isn't that ever so much a thug?	0	0	0
