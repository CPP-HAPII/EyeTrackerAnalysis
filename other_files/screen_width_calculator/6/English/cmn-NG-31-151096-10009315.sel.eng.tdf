When part, you still want to cry your heart out and say "I love you" loudly one more time; perhaps you have to part because of family objection, you want to say that you truly hope that he will not get married and live with another woman, you truly do not wish him happiness; he has another woman, you curse viciously and curse the woman, you also give him a slap in the face harshly before you leave.	0	0	0
