cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	600.0	700.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	I received a notice on May 30, which said it was received. I checked the status, and it turned out to be received on May 27, received and pending.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	800.0	900.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	I waited till the middle of July and still did not hear anything from them. I checked online for processing time, and it had only got to a bit past April. This made me worried.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	900.0	1000.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	I hurried over to ISO to inquire about it and was told to just wait patiently. Furthermore, if I had still not received the card after August 1, I would not be able to continue receiving payment or working for others (even if for my boss).	0	0	0

cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	1200.0	1300.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	The sly Indian guy said with something of a smirk, "Research is part of your studies and you have to do it even if there is no pay." I was too angry to speak.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	1300.0	1400.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Extremely depressed, I went back home and waited, because I'd have to change my address by the end of July. I originally thought of changing my address with USCIS. BF said that changing the address might prolong my waiting time (it was proved later to be totally nonsense, and the sooner it was changed, the better), so I did not change it. I only registered my email address with USCIS. Once there is any change in the status of my case, it would send me an email.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	1500.0	1600.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	I received a letter on August 1 (at 7:00 Friday evening), and the status had become "approval notice sent."	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	1700.0	1800.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	I checked online to find out how many days it would take to arrive and accidentally found that the mail from USCIS would not be forwarded after the change of address. My great joy turned into great shock.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	2200.0	2300.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Dejected, I came back to work and at the same time called the customer service at USCIS. People there were actually very nice and changed the address for me, while saying that the card had not been mailed yet and it could be likely mailed directly to the new address.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	2400.0	2500.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	On the evening of August 4, the status of the case continued to change. In the morning I received a letter which said "card production ordered" on August 1. In the afternoon I received a letter saying that the card had already been mailed out to the address on file on August 4.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	2600.0	2700.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Feeling rather sympathetic to me, a poor girl student, the two supervisors said they would explain my situation to the carrier and I immediately left my name, new and old addresses, and cell phone number.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	2700.0	2800.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Around 5:50 in the afternoon I received a telephone message from the postman (I missed the call while doing my work). He said he did not find the letter I was waiting for, but he would continue to watch out for it.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	2900.0	3000.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	I was very busy all day long on August 6 and didn't go to the post office. I continued to make my inquiry at the post office on August 7, but still there was no letter.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	3100.0	3200.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	On August 8 because I wanted to watch the Olympics opening ceremony, I was rushing my work during the day and watching NBC in the evening, which diverted my attention a little bit.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	3200.0	3300.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	On August 9, I went to work on an extra shift. When I came back and checked the mailbox, I found a forwarded letter without any address and without any USCIS logo. It was completely different from the envelop containing the notice I received earlier, but it was from vermont.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	3400.0	3500.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Some suggestions for my fellow students who haven't got it yet: Once you need to change your address, the sooner, the better. USCIS is very slow in changing addresses. Moreover, it is not enough just to fill the AR-11; you also need to fill another form.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	3500.0	3600.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	The AR-11 only tells them that you have changed it. Their database won't update that information.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	3600.0	3700.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	In addition, the envelope containing the card bore no USCIS logo, and it could be possibly forwarded.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-4-76579-10672917	0	3700.0	3800.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	At least mine could. I don't know whether it was a special precedent made by that carrier after being persistently harassed for a week by me.	0	0	0
