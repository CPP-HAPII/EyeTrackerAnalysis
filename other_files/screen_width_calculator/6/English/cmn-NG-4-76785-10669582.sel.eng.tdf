cmn-NG-4-76785-10669582	0	100.0	200.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	I want to do a PhD, my favorite major is still economics, but right now I'm studying an MBA, which has nothing much in common. It isn't easy to get accepted, and even if I get in it'll still be tough, my economics foundation isn't great.	0	0	0
