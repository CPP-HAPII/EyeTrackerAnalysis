cmn-NG-31-117684-10536916	0	100.0	200.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Due to the Anna Mae He case, the State of Tennessee is considering to draft the "Anna Mae He Act." Information source: Internet Communities: May 8, 2007 03:47:07, although the Supreme Court of the State of Tennessee decided the parental rights back to the couple, He Shaoqiang and Luo Qin in the Anna Mae He case, this high profile case did show the lack of clear definition of "child abandonment" in the book of law in the State of Tennessee. Thus the State House of Representatives is currently holding hearings on the amendments related to HB351 legislation.	0	0	0
