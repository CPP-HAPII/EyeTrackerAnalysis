cmn-NG-31-121778-9955803	0	900.0	1000.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	I'm still all in tears now when I think back of what I had to go through after advancing into heroic instances. A T without proper gears, a T incapable of sustaining the boss, and a T without the support of lots of friends standing by, how could I survive against all odds?	0	0	0

I studied where all the warrior gears were dropped in various raids; there was no chance to go to places such as Karazhan. The three pieces of Felsteel set were the best warrior gears I was able to acquire at that time. Blizzard still had some shred of humanity left in them, leaving me with a way out.	0	0	0

I sincerely advise all my friends who have become warriors or are thinking of becoming warriors find a different way out and never make an attempt.	0	0	0

Other shields were too big as well, and the gnome warrior had to carry it tilted on his back).	0	0	0
