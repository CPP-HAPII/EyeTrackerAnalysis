The power of the mafia could already make it impossible for justice to be served: a petition with nearly two thousand signatures from the citizens in Xuzhou was consistently disregarded over a period of two years. The investigation could not be carried out in spite of written instructions from the provincial governor, and the written instructions from the provincial Party secretary were of no use, either -- leaders at the grassroots level used their official powers to fraudulently and forcibly cover up extremely obvious illegal crimes such as the mafia's seizure and private division of proprietors' property. Some leaders from grassroots party and government departments used their official powers to brazenly launder illegal money for the mafia, allowing criminal suspects to escape the punishment of law on a long-term basis, while the mafia brazenly attacked the petitioners in retaliation.	0	0	0

Moreover, the amounts were enormous and he was already suspected of criminal offenses, but leaders at the grassroots level used their official powers to fraudulently and forcibly cover up Liu Yongxiu's extremely obvious illegal crimes such as seizure and private division of the proprietors' property.

The power of the mafia could already make it impossible for justice to be served: Liu Yongxiu's extremely obvious illegal crimes were forcibly covered up because the leaders of the grass-roots offices as well as the Party and government departments fraudulently filed false charges. As the lower level cheated the high level, the high level furthermore cheated their higher-ups. A petition with nearly two thousand signatures from the citizens in Xuzhou was consistently disregarded over a period of two years.
