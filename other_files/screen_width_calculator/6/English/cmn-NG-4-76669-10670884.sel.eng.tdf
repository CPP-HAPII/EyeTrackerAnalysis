cmn-NG-4-76669-10670884	0	100.0	200.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	My English is relatively poor, it's not only an accent problem, even more importantly I don't know how to form sentences, don't know how to correctly express what I want to say in my head. Naturally my writing skills are no good either, but with a bit more time they could improve a little, somewhat better than my speaking.	0	0	0
