It is suspected of turning humans into objects as well as turning educational activities into a format and a model. The school life that should have been lively, fresh, full of vitality, and rich significance, especially the classroom activities, has become trivial, mediocre, boring and depressing.	0	0	0

One, the government at various levels as well as elementary and middle schools have failed to implement and guarantee the regulation that "no tuition should be charged to students" as clearly set forth in the "Compulsory Education Law." This practice where the government and schools take the lead in charging fees in violation of the law is defeating the goal of building a country under the rule of law by the ruling political party. Two, the widespread practice of collecting fees during the compulsory education period and collecting arbitrary fees defeats the goal of the country to popularize compulsory education.	0	0	0
