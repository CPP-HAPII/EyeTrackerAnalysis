In addition to what they had consumed prior to 1966, they also lived on relief grain for twelve consecutive years. Were "People's Communes" not run and did agriculture not "fail" in other areas so that they were able to provide Xiaogang village with relief grain?	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-31-117651-10711568	0	2800.0	2900.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Secondly, I checked the "Statistical Data and Materials on Fifty Years of New China" (published in 1999 by China Statistical Publishing House), and in 1977 (The year 1977 was chosen because no "bloody fingerprints" had been printed yet), the sown area in rural Anhui was 8,194.00 (in thousands of hectares); the sown area of grain was 6,349.25 (in thousands of hectares). The grain sown ratio was 77.5%.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-31-117651-10711568	0	2900.0	3000.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	So, according to the logic of planned economy, calculated on this ratio, the sown area of grain in Xiaogang village was 400.6 mu.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-31-117651-10711568	0	3000.0	3100.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Grain planted per capita was 3.64 mu.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-31-117651-10711568	0	3100.0	3200.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Thirdly, based on "from 1966 to 1978, ... A total of 114,000 kilograms of relief grain was consumed, which was one third more than the grain they had produced by themselves...," assuming that the grain produced for twelve years was x, a formula was set for calculation. In the course of twelve years, Xiaogang village had produced a total of 85,500 kilograms of grain, equivalent of 171,000 jin, averaging an annual production of 14,250 jin of grain. Given that 400 mu of arable land were planted with grain, it was calculated that the average output per mu was 35.6 jin.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-31-117651-10711568	0	3300.0	3400.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Fourthly, it is commonly known that the Qinghai-Tibet plateau has the worst climate conditions and other conditions for agricultural production in our country. According to what is said in "Relying on Science and Technology for Innovation," a treatise by Associate Professor Tubden Kyedrub at the Department of Economics and Management of Tibet University, "according to what was recorded in 'The Comprehensive History of Dbus-gtsang,' during the reign of Kangxi, a ke of land in the Dbus-gtsang region could produce six or seven ke of naked barley (As the Tibetan measurement unit, one ke is equivalent to some ten-plus jin). By the time of the democratic reform when more than three hundred years had passed, the average grain output per unit in Tibet was also just six or seven ke, some 100-plus jin." Such was the description of agricultural production in Tibet with no progress whatsoever in the course of three hundred years.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-31-117651-10711568	0	3500.0	3600.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	However, logically speaking, no matter how poor the agricultural production conditions in Xiaogang village located in Anhui were, they should still be better than the agricultural production conditions in Tibet during the reign of Kangxi.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-31-117651-10711568	0	3600.0	3700.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	CCTV once made a comparative report on Tibet, old and new, saying that during the period of serfdom, the grain harvested was not much more than the seeds sown.	0	0	0		
cmn-NG-31-117651-10711568	0	3700.0	3800.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	In my humble opinion, no matter what, the People's Commune and production brigades should still be better than the system of serfdom. How could the grain output per unit of a production brigade located in a low elevation region stay for a long time at just 30-plus, 20-plus jin?	0	0	0
