CNS_CMN_20080411.0656	0	500.0	600.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Zhang Yansheng, head of the International Economic Research Institute of the National Development and Reform Commission, said that logically speaking with downward pressure from the international capital movement, America's sub-prime crisis and global economic slowdown, the adjustments of our country's trade and foreign capital policies this year, as well as increase in factor costs, should have also put downward pressure on foreign investment.	0	0	0

It was kept at above 50%, with the highest exceeding 63% at one point. However, the proportion has already dropped to about 20% in the first quarter this year.	0	0	0

One reason is that a trust relationship has not been built with many of the new local governments and the investment is still in a wait-and-see stage. In addition, some foreign investments are also casting a greedy eye on the Chinese capital market," said Wei Fengchun.	0	0	0

CNS_CMN_20080411.0656	0	1900.0	2000.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Wei Fengchun believes more international capital will enter China at the start of the second quarter. On the one hand it is because the interest rate gap between the US dollar and RMB is still widening; and on the other hand a large amount of the international capital retreated to the originating countries under the influence of the US sub-prime crisis last year. However "when bleeding has stopped, the best wound treatment method is to 'relieve the state of Zhao by besieging the state of Wei,' i.e. only by making profit in the emerging markets can losses from the sub-prime loans be truly compensated."	0	0	0
