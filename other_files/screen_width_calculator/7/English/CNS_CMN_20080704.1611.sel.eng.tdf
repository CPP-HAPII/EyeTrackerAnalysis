However, since some schools, especially those in rural and remote mountainous areas, are not too aware of lightning protection, some new, altered, and extended buildings have not been designed and inspected on completion for lightning protection as required. They have not carried out regular tests on existing lightning protection devices, nor conducted timely rectifications for existing hidden risks in lightning protection, resulting in frequent accidents of lightning strikes that cause casualties of teachers and students and economic losses.	0	0	0
