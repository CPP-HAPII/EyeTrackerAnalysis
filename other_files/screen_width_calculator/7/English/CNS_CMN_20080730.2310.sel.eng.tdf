He said that when the team was not in a good shape either in attacks or defense, the issue of the setter's inadequacy won't be able to be compensated.

Although the alternate setter Wei Qiuyue worked quite smoothly with Wang Yimei and Xue Ming, she is not as skillful as Feng Kun working with veterans like Zhao Ruirui, Yang Hao, and Zhou Suhong, and is also less experienced.	0	0	0
