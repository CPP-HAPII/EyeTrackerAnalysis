One is the enrolling of the high-school graduates into the aviation academies ahead of other colleges or universities after they pass the admission examinations for high-learning. They receive four years of training in the aviation academies. The second channel is to offer skills training to the 2nd year or 3rd year college students for two years of specific training. The third channel is to convert pilots in the military services to civil aviation pilots.	0	0	0

Therefore, it is absolutely inacceptable to "ease requirements and conditions for choosing and employing pilots" while keeping only the number of needed pilots in mind. This would result in hidden safety hazards in the future.	0	0	0
