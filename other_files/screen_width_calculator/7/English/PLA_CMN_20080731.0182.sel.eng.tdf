PLA_CMN_20080731.0182	0	600.0	700.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	In order to make new riders adapt promptly to their own positions and send them to fill up teaching and support positions in time, the coaching group at the Academy of Armored Forces Engineering, aiming at the high goal of "going all out to train qualified professionals," in addition to sending a few out to study, assigning them to study at the plant, and inviting instructors over to coach them, voluntarily stepped up the self-training and re-training of new riders. With meticulous planning, highly competent instructors, solid studying, rigorous teaching, and scientific group training, within just four months, all new riders not only met the requirements and passed the exams, but some of them also managed to be experts in one field while competent in several skills, laying solid foundation for future teaching positions.	0	0	0
