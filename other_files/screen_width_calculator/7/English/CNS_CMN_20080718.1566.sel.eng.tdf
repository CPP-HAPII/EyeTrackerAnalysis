CNS_CMN_20080718.1566	0	400.0	500.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	After getting to the fire scene, the commanding officers investigated and found that what was on fire was an improvised warehouse storing dangerous chemicals, such as paint. The fire was at the stage of fierce expansion and quickly spreading to a neighboring warehouse of Shandong TV Station to the east, which stored sceneries and props (about 500,000 yuan worth of materials). Conditions were critical. The commanding officers of the brigade decided to split up by using two fire guns from a 15-ton tanker, one for containing the fire in the warehouse of chemicals from the southern top of it and the other for controlling the fire spreading eastward to prevent a larger area of fire.	0	0	0
