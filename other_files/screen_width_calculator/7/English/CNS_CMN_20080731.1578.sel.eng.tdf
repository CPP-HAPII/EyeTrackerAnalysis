Yesterday morning, after receiving a call on their hotline from the Dazhou City Bureau of Aquatic Products, reporters rushed to the scene where they saw a staffer using a wash basin to hold jellyfish that were about the size of a 50-cent coin. With neither head nor tail, they were floating like peach blossom petals in water. Transparent and pure, as soft as silk, they contracted and expanded in water, fluttering up and down, carefree and content. Slowly floating up and down like parachutes in the air, they were exceptionally graceful in the pond.	0	0	0

CNS_CMN_20080731.1578	0	600.0	700.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Deng Xiaojun, deputy engineer-in-chief of the Bureau of Aquatic Products, told the reporters: "Through data referencing and confirmation from several specialists and professors, it has been confirmed that this precious and rare creature discovered in Daxian County is indeed a species of Peach Blossom Jellyfish." It is definitely rare for such large numbers of Peach Blossom Jellyfish to appear all at once in a small area of water.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20080731.1578	0	700.0	800.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Specialists and professors all believe that because Peach Blossom Jellyfish has extremely demanding requirements for its survival environment, and the water must not be polluted in any way, it is even rarer to see them alive and very difficult to make them into specimens, thus ruling out the possibility that they were bred in captivity.	0	0	0

If this precious and rare species becomes extinct, not only would it be a loss to the diversification of our country's species, but it would also be a permanent loss to the cultural resources of "peach blossom fish" as recorded in our country's ancient times.	0	0	0
