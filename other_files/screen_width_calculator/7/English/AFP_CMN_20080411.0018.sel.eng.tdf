AFP_CMN_20080411.0018	0	0.0	1000.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	In Zimbabwe's presidential, parliamentary, and local council elections held on March 29, although the opposition party "Movement for Democratic Change" (MDC) was ahead of the ruling party "the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front" (Zanu-PF) in the lower house of the parliament, and MDC presidential candidate Tsvangirai also announced that he had been elected president by 50.3% of the vote, this general election had come to an impasse after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission had been unwilling to release presidential election results for a prolonged time.	0	0	0

Although Tsvangirai claims that he is ready to confront Mugabe in the second round, he is also concerned that the electoral commission's prolonged delay in releasing presidential election results was to give Mugabe more sufficient time to deal with opposition party supporters with violence.	0	0	0
