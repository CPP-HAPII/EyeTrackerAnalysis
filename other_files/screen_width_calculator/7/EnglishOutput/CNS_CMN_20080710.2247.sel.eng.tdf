As a resource for developing tourism with unique characteristics, it will be of great help to the reconstruction of the locality and to the improvement of the economies and livelihood of the local residents who suffered from the disaster. Secondly, it was originally planned even before the earthquake occurred that a Xuanping Hydropower Station with an installation capacity of 150,000 KWH would be built by constructing a dam of 100 meters in height at 3-4 kilometers upstream of the barrier lake. Through further reinforcements and scientific planning, the natural dam structure of Tangjiashan barrier lake can be used for hydropower purposes.	0	0	0
