According to reports, the background to this is that some coastal provinces repeatedly wrote letters to the Central Government, requesting a solution of the survival issues of private enterprises. The other is the CPI movement in the entire first half of the year. In spite of a drop in June, it is still far from the 4.8% target set by Premier Wen at the beginning of the year. Since it is now summer, a season when CPI statistics tend to drop, the gap of nearly 3% from the control target inevitably cause people to feel concern about what the CPI and the macro-economic situation will be for the entire year.	0	0	0		CNS_CMN_20080718.1088	0	1100.0	1200.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	If the entire macro situation is taken into account, such adjustment will appear even more necessary. What is of equal importance is not only CPI, but also the economic development and the coordination between the targets.	0	0	0		CNS_CMN_20080718.1088	0	3200.0	3300.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	It can be mentioned in passing that people have suggested that, in the second half of the year, the policy of raising interest rates should be used in lieu of the reserve ratio policy. Please allow me to quote former Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan again: Interest rate policy is ineffective (for adjustment of economy), for a very simple reason: cost does not decide value (of a project).	0	0	0
