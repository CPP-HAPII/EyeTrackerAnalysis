"Once key issues are taken care of, everything falls into place." We should get hold of the core, find a logical starting point, and employ the thinking and methods of top-tier designs.	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	4500.0	4600.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Scientific thinking requires the unification of the three types of judgments, but we often lack the third type of judgment and always think first about the impossibility.	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	5900.0	6000.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	After taking office as defense secretary, McNamara implemented the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System, that is, the PPBS system.	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	6200.0	6300.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	The PPBS system made the American military change its thinking of "Exactly how much spending is enough?" to thinking first of "Exactly what should we do," thereby enhancing the rationality of the use of national defense resources.	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	8200.0	8300.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Li: Scientific strategic planning requires our military construction to shift its focus on events to a focus on the process.	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	9600.0	9700.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Li: Scientific strategic planning requires us to pay attention to ideals and limitations.	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	10300.0	10400.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Well said. If resources were unlimited, what do we need planning for?	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	11300.0	11400.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	We can see that the special characteristics of this method and thinking are to grasp reality from the future, let mission determine capability, let capability create technology and select structures, and so on.	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	11600.0	11700.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Li: What strategic planning must absolutely avoid is "being confused by major practical problems of today."	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	11700.0	11800.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	If we do not plan far ahead, we are certain to suffer immediate worries.	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	11900.0	12000.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Looking at the developmental situations of foreign militaries, many practical problems mostly come from "carrying out construction without blueprints" or "putting military on the march without a target."	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	12100.0	12200.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Sometimes, the hard work put into solving a certain practical problem actually brings about even more numerous and more prominent new problems. As a result, reform measures spin around on the same level and in the same dimension.	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	12500.0	12600.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	The "short plank effect" that we used to talk about means that the shortest plank of a barrel determines how much water it can hold.	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	13000.0	13100.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	From the point of view of development, the "long plank effect" creates new capabilities even more directly than the "short plank effect" does.	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	14000.0	14100.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	His method was proposing for gathering all air force admirals to hold a summit meeting after one year. No discussion on current problems was allowed (to avoid being involved in and debating over the practical interests of each department); but there should be a special exploration of what the United States Air Force would be like 20-30 years after. Then proposals about what should be done now could be brought forth by looking retrospectively at today from the future.	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	19000.0	19100.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	People often say, "Planning cannot keep up with change." Making plans requires being scientific, and dealing with changes cannot be separated from art.	0	0	0		PLA_CMN_20080429.0134	0	19700.0	19800.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	In your book you said that strategic planning is a team effort as well as a science and art passed down through the generations. This is very important.	0	0	0
