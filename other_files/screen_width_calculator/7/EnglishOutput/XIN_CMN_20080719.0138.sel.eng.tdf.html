Thus, a hit is valid only when the 1.5cm tip of the sword lands on the opponent. For sabre, however, a point is scored when either its tip or body lands on the opponent.	0	0	0		XIN_CMN_20080719.0138	0	1900.0	2000.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	The part of the body for a valid hit is the torso, excluding limbs and head, for foils; the upper body, mask and arms for sabers; any part of the body for epees.	0	0	0		XIN_CMN_20080719.0138	0	2000.0	2100.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Besides, foil and sabre matches are subject to the priority of hit, meaning that an attacker scores only when he/she launches the attack first and hits the opponent. A defender, on his/her part, must put up a valid defense act first and then attack and hit the opponent to score.	0	0	0
