In 1984, the temporary residence permit system was implemented. In 2006, the "1-5" document on population administration was promulgated to reform the system for administering temporary residence permits by reducing the category of certificates, lowering threshold, simplifying procedure and clarifying the rights of permit holders. The residence permit system to be implemented starting from August 1 will initiate a new stage.	0	0	0		CNS_CMN_20080731.0932	0	3100.0	3200.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	A person in charge said that after the abolishment of the state regulations on reception, the effects of implementation of Shenzhen's system of temporary residence permits is not obvious.
