Of five children, two starved to death, an elder sister and an elder brother. You can ask the people in our native place about that. Later, the five people in our family lived in a mud-thatch hut smaller than 40m2, which stands even today. I lived there for 16 years. In my boyhood, I really thirsted for help from others.	0	0	0		CNS_CMN_20080703.0754	0	2800.0	2900.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	An iron bar was used to pin up the wire cable from below the floor slab. Then, the floor slab was fixed with iron wire ropes below it. Then I saw the dust on it. The dust was very thick on the rubble. In the rubble, there was a boy shouting. He was crying for help. My people found a wood board and inserted it slowly inside below the floor slab as our crane hoisted it up.	0	0	0		CNS_CMN_20080703.0754	0	3000.0	3100.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	A crack, a very loud crack. After we hoisted up the slab, a large amount of soil and debris slid down. We feared that would choke the nose of the boy and he would easily die from that. Therefore, as we lifted the floor slab slowly, we inserted the board slowly in. The dust that fell on the board was this thick. Then, we slowly dumped the dust and dragged the boy out.	0	0	0
