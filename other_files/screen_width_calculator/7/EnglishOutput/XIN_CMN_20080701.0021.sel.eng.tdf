The key midfielder of the champion Spanish team, number 8 Xavi from Barcelona, became the recipient of the highest individual honor of this year's EUFA European Championship.	0	0	0		XIN_CMN_20080701.0021	0	200.0	300.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Xavi, who is 28 years old this year, played five out of the six games for the Spanish team. In the last of the group matches, Xavi was placed on the bench for a rest as the Spanish team has already advanced to the next round.	0	0	0		XIN_CMN_20080701.0021	0	600.0	700.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	In most of the games in this season's championship, Xavi has always been substituted by Fabregas by Aragones, and under these circumstances it is very rare to still be voted the player of the tournament. In the match time Xavi plays he is the key figure of the Spanish team's offensive structure, and when the ball is passed to his feet, the opponents can do nothing against his free-flowing control. When he appears on the field at the same time as Fabregas, the Spanish team's attack from the midfield is at its scintillating best.	0	0	0
