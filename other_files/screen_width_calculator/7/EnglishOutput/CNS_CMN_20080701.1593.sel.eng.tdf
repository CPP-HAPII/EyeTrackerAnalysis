When the manufacturer is contacted according to the information printed on the bags, the manufacturer cried out about their grievance, claiming that the bags were not their products," explained Dong. Some market administrators sell plastic shopping bags to the merchants at the price of 0.2 yuan each. The merchants fear that the price is too high for customers and, therefore, turn to low-quality counterfeit "national standard" bags, which can be given to customers free of charge without costing them dearly.	0	0	0
