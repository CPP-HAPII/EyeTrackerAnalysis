For example, some local unions have been commissioned by the People's Court to carry out mediations before labor disputes were litigated. Some grass-roots people's courts have practices for setting up labor dispute courts, employee welfare collegiate benches, and labor dispute circuit courts, appoint qualified cadres from trade unions to serve as jurors in accordance with legal procedures, and participate in labor dispute cases.
