The correspondent was informed yesterday by Sichuan Architecture Science Research Institute that the first working meeting of revising the Standards for Assessing Earthquake Resistance of Buildings will be held in Beijing today.	0	0	0		CNS_CMN_20080709.2874	0	1300.0	1400.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	After the current earthquake, some of the areas will be upgraded to 0.15g in accordance with the different distances from the epicenter, the different depths of seismic focus and different geologic impacts from the earthquake. It means that the original level of Grade 7 resistances is upgraded by half a degree.	0	0	0		CNS_CMN_20080709.2874	0	1500.0	1600.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	However, the Standards for Assessing Earthquake Resistance of Buildings made in the year of 1995 does not involve the corresponding methods for assessing the earthquake resistances of the buildings in the Level 7 1/2(ol15g) and Level 8 (0.30g) areas.	0	0	0		CNS_CMN_20080709.2874	0	1800.0	1900.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	In the current assessments of the earthquake resistances, some of the working staffs followed the above standards in assessing the buildings constructed after the year of 1992, which resulted in the confusions with regard to the standards of assessments. Therefore, it is very urgent to make modifications and revisions to the assessment standards for the earthquake resistances of the buildings so as to clarify what specific standard is to be followed in assessing the buildings constructed in different years.	0	0	0
