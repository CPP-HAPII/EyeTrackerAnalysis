But, the energy density of electromagnetic weapons is extremely high and can cause the temperature of an invisible target to skyrocket in a instant to "expose the target".	0	0	0		CNS_CMN_20080716.0412	0	2700.0	2800.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Military powers paying equal attention to "spear and shield"	0	0	0
