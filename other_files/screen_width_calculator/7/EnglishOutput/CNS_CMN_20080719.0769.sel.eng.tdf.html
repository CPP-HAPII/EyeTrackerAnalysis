After they sold the stocks, they reaped illegal profits of more than 50 million Yuan and one million Yuan, respectively.	0	0	0		CNS_CMN_20080719.0769	0	700.0	800.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	Dong Zhengqing said that Guangfa Securities had the intention of getting listed in the market as early as January 2006, but due to some "bruises" in the company's history and performance, it was difficult for it to achieve an IPO. Therefore, on March 31, 2006, a collective decision was made to choose the more time-saving and easier way to "enter through a backdoor." A specific operation of "finding a backdoor" was handled by the company's executive vice president at the time, (the present acting president), Li Jianyong, vice president, Qin Li, and general manger of M & A, Xiao Xuesheng.	0	0	0		CNS_CMN_20080719.0769	0	1400.0	1500.0	speaker	unknown	unknown	When he heard about the rumors of using backdoors, he tried to call Dong Zhengqing to verify, but the phone call did not get through. Subsequently, Yan Bian Highway issued a clarification notice, but he still bought about 430,000 Yan Bian Highway shares (instead of 490,000 shares of the allegations) between May 15 and 18 in 2006.	0	0	0
