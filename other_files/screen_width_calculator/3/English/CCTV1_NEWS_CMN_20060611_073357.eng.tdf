CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	3.432	9.262	Wen_Jing	female	native	Many thanks to all of you who are continuing to watch our program after the advertisements. We'll continue to read the newspapers for you at Media Square. Let's now take a look at the topics.	1	1	1	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	9.262	14.355	Wen_Jing	female	native	First, let's look at China Disciplinary Examination & Supervision Report, which reported the story of a man and what occurred to him.	1	1	2	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	14.355	17.139	Wen_Jing	female	native	This man, uh, the protagonist is called Liu Chengzhang.	1	1	3	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	17.139	28.707	Wen_Jing	female	native	Why is it said that it's been a lifetime of keeping watch, uh? When Liu Chengzhang was little, uh, he and his father was once captured by the Japanese and made to dig trenches, but later, uh, he and his father were rescued by the Eighth Route Army.	1	1	4	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	28.707	35.488	Wen_Jing	female	native	After being rescued, ah, his father then said to Liu Chengzhang, saying, Our Liu family, yeah, should not forget the kindness of the Eighth Route Army for generations to come.	1	1	5	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	35.488	39.869	Wen_Jing	female	native	This incident, uh, just planted in little Liu Chengzhang's heart, yeah, a seed of love, heh.	1	1	6	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	39.869	44.536	Wen_Jing	female	native	Er, the second, the second paragraph of the report tells of a moving and tragic scene that was forever fixed in time.	1	1	7	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	44.536	52.639	Wen_Jing	female	native	This was an incident that happened in their village later. Liu Chengzhang saw with his own eyes 72 soldiers of the Eighth Route Army, ah, being killed in the midst, uh, of a fierce battle.	1	1	8	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	52.639	58.541	Wen_Jing	female	native	This incident, uh, left an indelible impression in his heart, and he and the villagers together, uh, buried those 72 soldiers, ah.	1	1	9	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	58.541	63.042	Wen_Jing	female	native	Afterwards, Liu Chengzhang continuously guarded these graves, ah, the graves of the 72 soldiers.	1	1	10	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	63.042	77.149	Wen_Jing	female	native	Er, in the beginning, uh, it was he himself, afterwards, uh, after he got married, after he started his family, uh, he would bring his wife, and even more, uh, in the year of ninety something, ah, in the year of ninety something he specially, uh, relocated his family, yeah, to this place, in 1996, to specially keep watch over the graves.	1	1	11	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	77.149	79.867	Wen_Jing	female	native	So that is why this report says it has been a lifetime of keeping watch, uh.	1	1	12	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	79.867	83.163	Wen_Jing	female	native	Keeping watch over the graves for 65 years, ah, now he has already passed away.	1	1	13	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	83.163	90.537	Wen_Jing	female	native	Eh, so for us, ah, probably one person's persistence in keeping such a memory in their heart, ah, and persisted for a lifetime, for us this is moving.	1	1	14	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	90.537	94.522	Wen_Jing	female	native	I think perhaps for him, that was one part spiritual sustenance, probably also one part happiness.	1	1	15	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	94.522	98.633	Wen_Jing	female	native	Next, there is also a rather moving incident, and this is reported by the Guangming Daily.	1	1	16	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	98.633	104.502	Wen_Jing	female	native	In the "Know Honor from Dishonor, Establish the New Trend" column, heh, which is about civilized etiquette, it says a warm-hearted cab driver builds an image of a civilized city.	1	1	17	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	104.502	116.207	Wen_Jing	female	native	This warm-hearted cab driver, uh, was named Zhu Ronghai. He's a cab driver from Fuzhou, Fujian. In the college entrance exam time, yeah, he, uh, offered free, ah, rides to an impoverished test-taker every day, uh, to the test center.	1	1	18	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	116.207	121.075	Wen_Jing	female	native	Moreover, uh, it says that he -- this is not to say that it's the first time he's done good deeds; he has been consistently doing so all the times.	1	1	19	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	121.075	131.648	Wen_Jing	female	native	For example, if they're on the road and run into somebody who's injured, well, with blood pouring out, other cab drivers, uh, would all be afraid to get the cab dirty, so would avoid this +like the plague. Only he, yeah, would immediately take the person to the hospital for treatment.	1	1	20	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	131.648	145.061	Wen_Jing	female	native	Also, for example, if on the road he runs into this crying kid, who has obviously got separated from the grown-ups, at this time, uh, he also definitely would take this kid and drive around, ah, no matter how much trouble it took, in short, uh, he would definitely get this kid, uh, safely to the parents.	1	1	21	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	145.061	154.371	Wen_Jing	female	native	So, yeah, everyone, uh, also considers him, ah, all think this taxi cab AT1653, yeah, simply is an exemplary cab, ah, and the driver, uh, is also a warm-hearted one, and everybody knows it.	1	1	22	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	154.371	168.786	Wen_Jing	female	native	The most important thing, uh, is that the strength of this example by him, ah, is indeed endless. It is said that in their area, uh, more than 60 cab drivers have been influenced by him this year. Ah, you can see that they are voluntarily joining, um, those in giving test-takers, um, free ride service to the test centers.	1	1	23	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	168.786	175.902	Wen_Jing	female	native	Of course, ah, we also hope, heh, that as cab drivers establish the new image of the city, uh, the strength of this example can also endlessly carry the effort forward.	1	1	24	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	175.902	181.419	Wen_Jing	female	native	Let's look again at the Workers' Daily. The front page lead story in today's Workers' Daily is a report about Wei Mujin.	1	1	25	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	181.419	184.589	Wen_Jing	female	native	What's the story with Wei Mujin? Well, he is an elderly man.	1	1	26	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	184.589	203.461	Wen_Jing	female	native	It says that in Nanchang, ah, this old man always rises a little past 4 o'clock every day at dawn, then, uh, walks by himself out the door, and what does he do? It says that in the silent streets, when people are still sleeping soundly, he quietly goes around getting rid of each piece of the little advertisements which have been called "the city's psoriasis."	1	1	27	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	203.461	205.367	Wen_Jing	female	native	He has kept at this already for more than five years.	1	1	28	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	205.367	212.880	Wen_Jing	female	native	In these five years his tracks, yeah, have covered all the streets, big and small, throughout the city, along the way removing 140,000 pieces of the little advertisements, ah.	1	1	29	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	212.880	226.226	Wen_Jing	female	native	Er, it says this old man, uh, also has developed a -- +discovered a knack, that is, while removing little advertisements, ah, he has discovered, uh, that if you dig up -- first dig up a little corner, then peel it like this, you can just tear it off. Practice indeed makes perfect, ah.	1	1	30	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	226.226	239.830	Wen_Jing	female	native	After taking it off, well, he doesn't throw it away. The old man, uh, then takes each one of the advertisements home, ah, and then pastes them properly. Then, uh, he categorizes and +screens them, reporting and relaying some of these addresses, information and telephone numbers to relevant authorities.	1	1	31	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	239.830	244.329	Wen_Jing	female	native	A really dedicated person, isn't he? Furthermore, uh, he persevered, ah, for five years, ah.	1	1	32	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	244.329	249.674	Wen_Jing	female	native	So that's why the title is called "The five-year battle between the grassroots common man and the little advertisements," ah.	1	1	33	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	249.674	259.980	Wen_Jing	female	native	This thing, ah, doesn't concern him at all, and he also can't control it, moreover, well, many people probably also -- the people who paste small advertisements will take him as an enemy. So to be able to persist for five years was definitely not easy, for this elderly man.	1	1	34	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	259.980	265.666	Wen_Jing	female	native	Let's now take a look at the next story, which is reported by the Workers' Daily, in another section, ah.	1	1	35	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	265.666	273.232	Wen_Jing	female	native	First take a look at this cartoon. The title of this cartoon, well, is "Who sets the standards in order to examine the standards."	1	1	36	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	273.232	279.811	Wen_Jing	female	native	Er, the cartoon probably doesn't look too clear, heh, er, everybody pay attention, it doesn't matter if it's a man or woman, they all have short hair.	1	1	37	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	279.811	286.567	Wen_Jing	female	native	Actually, ah, this is about a school, it says the school, well, has this rule, which is that male students must get crew cut hair cuts, and female students must have short hair.	1	1	38	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	286.567	291.009	Wen_Jing	female	native	When I saw this cartoon, I particularly empathized with it, because when I was in elementary school I went through the same kind of experience.	1	1	39	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	291.009	295.634	Wen_Jing	female	native	Actually, I always had long hair as a kid, one long ponytail braid which I myself especially liked.	1	1	40	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	295.634	300.850	Wen_Jing	female	native	But when I was in elementary school -- I forget which grade -- the teacher required you to have short hair, and with one snip of the scissors it was cut off.	1	1	41	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	300.850	305.130	Wen_Jing	female	native	Ever since, having long hair has always been a hard-to-fulfill, long-held dream of mine.	1	1	42	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	305.130	311.723	Wen_Jing	female	native	So I can especially understand it. This incident reported is in Dongguan, Guangdong. So I'd like to go into more details. This school in Dongguan, Guangdong, issued such a mandatory hair cut order.	1	1	43	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	311.723	316.190	Wen_Jing	female	native	But what I want to emphasize in my presentation is the attitudes that the relevant responsible persons in Bureau of Education in Dongguan have towards this.	1	1	44	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	316.190	318.940	Wen_Jing	female	native	They said that the hair cutting order is not appropriate,	1	1	45	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	318.940	324.722	Wen_Jing	female	native	because for the school's evaluation standards there is no rule about students' hair styles.	1	1	46	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	324.722	327.352	Wen_Jing	female	native	So, the school, uh, you have no right to do this.	1	1	47	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	327.352	329.743	Wen_Jing	female	native	Now this has set off a controversy, ah, this also is definitely normal.	1	1	48	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	329.743	337.826	Wen_Jing	female	native	You see, the responsible persons said that an order for mandatory hair cutting is clearly not in accordance with the school's humanistic management requirements.	1	1	49	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	337.826	340.091	Wen_Jing	female	native	This action is not appropriate, ah.	1	1	50	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	340.091	348.785	Wen_Jing	female	native	Let's look again at the Farmers' Daily. The Farmers' Daily, uh, in today's Opinion column, says there is one way of thinking that ought to be abandoned.	1	1	51	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	348.785	350.958	Wen_Jing	female	native	This thing, ah, also has some reasons.	1	1	52	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	350.958	359.101	Wen_Jing	female	native	It talks about Anxi county in Fujian province. This needs some special introduction about the background, because Anxi county, Fujian province, is a center for cell phone text message scams.	1	1	53	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	359.101	365.132	Wen_Jing	female	native	Er, last year, ah, especially before and after the lunar new year, uh, we especially focused on and emphasized this type of thing, reminding everyone not to be fooled.	1	1	54	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	365.132	371.834	Wen_Jing	female	native	Lots of people will receive a cell phone text message, saying such-and-such amount of money was charged to your bank card in that store in a certain, certain, certain place.	1	1	55	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	371.834	379.554	Wen_Jing	female	native	But as soon as you see it, uh -- you haven't spent that money at all, so -- lots of people get worked up the moment they see this text message, and will get in touch according to the phone number left in the message.	1	1	56	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	379.554	389.439	Wen_Jing	female	native	But as soon as you inquire about this, then you've fallen into the trap, ah. You just start to dial the phone number, then -- he just will tell you to go in front of an ATM, um, in front of the +ATM, uh, to carry out an account transfer.	1	1	57	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	389.439	400.822	Wen_Jing	female	native	Many people have been fooled, and this Anxi, Fujian, this place is just the site of the activity's centralization and spreading. So, uh, the relevant authorities, ah, have just over the whole county started this, this activity, which is to close down all +ATM's in the whole county.	1	1	58	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	400.822	405.071	Wen_Jing	female	native	This is also kind of laughable, heh, you see this article also introduces it. Actually, this kind of thing is not just a single case.	1	1	59	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	405.071	409.814	Wen_Jing	female	native	You -- for instance, Lingao county, Hainan, closed all Internet cafés, in the name of saving a generation of people.	1	1	60	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	409.814	414.987	Wen_Jing	female	native	Also, in Yingtan, Jiangxi, uh, as many as 10,000 dragon boats were smashed in the area with the government footing the bill.	1	1	61	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	414.987	424.481	Wen_Jing	female	native	Er, this also is fairly interesting, heh, so the article comments on -- says actually, ah, we all say that nowadays government management should all "put the people first," but doing this, uh, definitely is "putting management first."	1	1	62	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	424.481	426.820	Wen_Jing	female	native	So the article calls this...	1	1	63	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	426.820	436.772	Wen_Jing	female	native	Well, the article also comments on that incident, heh, saying that of course it is necessary for you to take serious precautions and strike back, heh, but there should not be a question of a contradiction between cracking down on the criminals and protecting ordinary people's peace and happiness.	1	1	64	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	436.772	443.512	Wen_Jing	female	native	If you crack down on the criminals at the cost of sacrificing the normal life and order of ordinary people for a long time, that won't +help things, and it's extremely superficial.	1	1	65	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	443.512	451.884	Wen_Jing	female	native	It's throwing the baby out with the bathwater, so, ah, ((pw)) this kind of thinking, uh, certainly needs to be abandoned.	1	1	66	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	451.884	453.587	Wen_Jing	female	native	Okay, we'll be right back.	1	1	67	report

CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1170.147	1183.497	Wen_Jing	female	native	Eh, this thing, ah, has actually been going on for some days, heh.

CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1195.809	1199.700	speaker#3	male	native	However, this kind of formula creates the possibility of the existence of fungi.	11	44	174	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1199.700	1206.418	speaker#3	male	native	The problem that Bausch & +Lomb's ReNu MoistureLoc contact lens solution can likely lead to fungal infections of the cornea was first discovered this February in Singapore.	11	44	175	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1206.418	1212.184	speaker#3	male	native	In the middle of May, Bausch & +Lomb Company announced a permanent halt to the sale of ReNu MoistureLoc contact lens solution on the global markets.	11	44	176	report

Now, experts remind test-takers and their parents that there are four serious considerations to bear in mind when filling out the preference form.	11	48	180	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1232.476	1240.007	speaker#3	male	native	First, you should consider the score. Test-takers should feel out how they did on the entrance exams, and estimate their own scores as well as their standings in the province and city.	11	49	181	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1240.007	1244.976	speaker#3	male	native	For example, if your score meets the first or second category of four-year colleges, you should approximately lock in the scope of the target universities.	11	49	182	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1244.976	1246.633	speaker#3	male	native	Second, you should consider your interests.	11	49	183	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1246.633	1252.022	speaker#3	male	native	Combine your own interests with the strengths of your target universities, and then decide which university and major you want.	11	49	184	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1252.022	1255.893	speaker#3	male	native	Third, when filling out the preference form, you should be aware of both the risk and the safety.	11	49	185	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1255.893	1264.538	speaker#4	female	native	For example, if your choices of school involve a little bit risk, then you should be relatively a bit more conservative when choosing your majors, or write that you are open to their assignment.	11	50	186	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1264.538	1270.091	speaker#4	female	native	If your choices for the first category are relatively risky, then you should be a little more conservative for the second category. You should be both aggressive and defensive.	11	50	187	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1270.091	1272.622	speaker#3	male	native	Finally, you also can't overlook the details.	11	51	188	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1272.622	1280.232	speaker#3	male	native	For example, the order of the majors being filled out. For many majors, priority is always given to enrolling those who choose them as their first choice. If you list them as your second choice on the application, you may not be able to enroll.	11	51	189	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1280.232	1289.592	Wen_Jing	female	native	So, experts, uh, in addition to reminding test-takers, ah, that there are these four considerations when filling out the preferences, uh, also mention that there are three types of traps in the recruitment that everyone should also guard against. Ah, and Zhao Pu and I, ah, are going to explain to you one by one.	11	52	190	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1289.592	1291.836	Zhao_Pu	male	native	Okay, you should listen close. First, uh, is the advertisement trap.	11	53	191	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1291.836	1297.898	Zhao_Pu	male	native	There are some, uh, leaflets with titles like "Guide to filling out preference forms," many of which, uh, all advertise for review study, and tutoring classes.	11	53	192	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1297.898	1300.430	Zhao_Pu	male	native	They just add some so-called information on how to fill out "preference forms."	11	53	193	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1300.430	1303.304	Zhao_Pu	male	native	This kind of leaflet is in fact a hidden advertisement.	11	53	194	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1303.304	1308.316	Wen_Jing	female	native	Right, er, the second, uh, is that some schools claim, ah, that they can make this self-study test equivalent to that of a regular-system student.	11	54	195	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1308.316	1316.843	Wen_Jing	female	native	In fact, uh, these schools, you should remember, ah, have no power to award regular-system student diplomas. Those students can only obtain self-study diplomas through passing the national self-study test.	11	54	196	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1316.843	1317.570	Zhao_Pu	male	native	Uh-huh.	11	55	197	report

CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1317.570	1321.335	Zhao_Pu	male	native	Third, uh, is that some frauds claim that they have so-called "inside quotas."	11	56	199	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1321.335	1326.317	Zhao_Pu	male	native	Now, national recruitment of students does not have "inside quotas" at all, and this is a kind of completely fraudulent behavior.	11	56	200	report	
CCTV1_NEWS_CMN_20060611_073357	0	1326.317	1333.835	Wen_Jing	female	native	As for these three major reminders -- four major reminders, three major traps, everyone should definitely remember them clearly. Okay, more great news is coming up right after a commercial break.	11	57	201	report
