In particular, the fourth largest financial institution in the U.S. just ((pw)) shut down. It was acquired, wasn't it? So the whole global economy and stock market are all not very good. Yesterday Xiangjiang stocks even dropped more than 1,000 points. So I think everyone is very concerned about China's economic situation, future development, and then China's future challenges.	4	9	18	filler	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	295.444	310.483	Wang_Xiao_Ya	female	native	I feel that the question Xiaoli asks is a bit similar to the question I want to ask, ah, let's hope we are lucky.

Thank you.	5	11	24	filler	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	335.950	394.917	Wen_Jia_Bao	male	native	There is also some basis to why we proposed this target. Currently our grain reserve remains between 150 million tonnes and 200 million tonnes. The situation where the supply of main industrial products exceeds the demand stays unchanged. As long as policies are suitable and the measures are strong, I -- we are fully confident of bringing the overly fast price increases under control.	5	12	25	filler	statement

At the conclusion of last year's press conference, uh, I handed it to the premier. The premier expressed his thanks for everyone. This year we've seen that a new leadership team has been established and a new five-year plan has been unveiled and implemented. All are new voices, and I hope that I can convey these voices to everyone.	6	13	27	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	426.824	433.738	Wang_Xiao_Ya	female	native	Hello, everyone. "Xiaoya's Coverage of the Two Conferences" will come to a close today. Although I've been covering the two conferences every day, I've been listening to everyone all along.	6	13	28	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	433.738	453.989	Wang_Xiao_Ya	female	native	During the two conferences, through the "Xiaoya's New Media Space" accessible on CCTV International, sina.com, qq.com and other websites, I did a large survey on the degree of concern about issues of people's well-being. The websites got nearly 25 million hits, averaging 1.56 million hits per day.

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	453.989	473.324	Wang_Xiao_Ya	female	native	I didn't anticipate either, uh, that there would be so many friends participating in our survey, and from their enthusiasm, uh, I also saw everyone's expectations of the new administration. Now let's first take a look, ah, at the result of this large survey on the degree of concern about issues of people's well-being. In one section of the survey on households with children, uh, people are most concerned about the second item: "enriching children's extracurricular activities."	6	13	30	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	473.324	481.853	Wang_Xiao_Ya	female	native	Let's now look at another survey on households with females. The vast majority of our female friends hope that a social culture in which women respect and cherish themselves should be advocated.	6	13	31	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	481.853	498.189	Wang_Xiao_Ya	female	native	Another section is on households with elderly people.

The comments of many friends, uh, all left a very deep impression on me. Now I'm going to share them with everyone, ah.	6	13	33	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	515.821	533.843	Wang_Xiao_Ya	female	native	A netizen said in his message that many students are now addicted to online games, with one very important reason, uh, being that we fail to conscientiously guide them. This friend, uh, proposes the establishment of a science and education experiment center to train children's hands-on skills and let them find fun, uh, in scientific experiments.	6	13	34	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	533.843	544.228	Wang_Xiao_Ya	female	native	Another netizen's comment on the education issue, uh, was very concise but, uh, very powerful. He said that good environments should be created to nurture real superior talents, not test-taking machines.	6	13	35	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	544.228	564.581	Wang_Xiao_Ya	female	native	Regarding the issue of ensuring pensions and medical care, uh, an issue everyone is also very concerned about, a friend said, uh, that for years the state, uh, has been expanding the development of the old-age insurance system; and the pension insurance for civil servants, employees of businesses and institutions, uh, is already relatively complete. So from now on, uh, efforts should be made to continue strengthening the development of the old-age insurance system in rural areas and a national policy must be enacted.	6	13	36	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	564.581	587.683	Wang_Xiao_Ya	female	native	In addition, uh, quite a few viewers wrote down what they earnestly wanted to tell the premier most through China Mobile's cell phone bulletin. Let's take a look. A friend whose cell phone number ends with 8483, uh, asked the premier a question. He said, why is that, uh, even though we talk about reducing students' burdens year after year, uh, many students feel their burden is getting heavier and heavier, uh? When are our students truly going to have their burdens reduced?	6	13	37	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	587.683	604.503	Wang_Xiao_Ya	female	native	Let's take a look at another friend whose cell phone number ends with 5483. He said, as an old person, I hope various welfare systems, uh, can improve as soon as possible to ensure that pension and medical care for the old will be truly implemented for each old person, so that we will enjoy a better life in the future and have greater peace of mind.	6	13	38	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	604.503	618.136	Wang_Xiao_Ya	female	native	To tell the truth, when I read the comments and SMS messages of these friends, I can really feel a sort of earnest anticipation, a kind of yearning for a happy life. In fact this sentiment of everyone is consistent with the atmosphere in which deputies and committee members made their suggestions and offered their advice amid heated discussions at the two conferences.	6	13	39	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	618.136	627.734	Wang_Xiao_Ya	female	native	Now that the two conferences have concluded, our attention to the issues of people's well-being will definitely continue, and the new administration will definitely come up with more solutions and measures regarding the issues of people's well-being.	6	13	40	report	statement

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	844.735	870.927	speaker#10	female	native	Premier Wen said that how to control the overly fast price increases and control inflation is not only an issue that ordinary people are concerned about, but also an important task for the government. Although we encountered a blizzard disaster rarely seen in history during the first two months of this year which brought greater pressure on price control, Premier Wen twice emphasized that the projected goal of limiting this year's price increase to around 4.8% remains unchanged, and that controlling prices and stemming inflation will be the top priority for government work this year.	8	17	45	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080318_210000	0	870.927	916.547	Wen_Jia_Bao	male	native	To be honest, it will not be easy to meet this target, but we still have not changed this target. As for the result, I'll have to wait until March next year to give everyone an answer. But I have a conviction, and that is: do not sheer away from difficulty, face up to responsibility and move forward bravely.	8	18	46	report	statement
