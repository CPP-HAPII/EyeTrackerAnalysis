However, when it's really time for them to buy a car, most of them do not choose the low-emission ones -- why? Let us take a look at the reporter's related investigation.	5	9	14	report	statement

CCTV1_30MINNEWS_CMN_20080403_115901	0	231.993	241.610	speaker#9	female	native	No. Because they are too small, inconvenient, and useless.	6	10	16	filler	statement

After all, it is more comfortable to sit in a bigger car. The small ones are not as comfortable. I guess safety-wise, the small ones are not as good as the big ones either.	6	11	18	filler	statement
CCTV1_30MINNEWS_CMN_20080403_115901	0	253.906	266.182	speaker#4	male	native	In addition to the lack of comfort, the small-emission models are relatively aging, their updates are slow; this is also the major reason that under the big background that current car consumption is upgrading, the majority of consumers do not choose low-emission cars.	7	12	19	report	statement
CCTV1_30MINNEWS_CMN_20080403_115901	0	266.182	275.966	speaker#4	male	native	In addition, some consumers said that compared with other vehicles, they do not have any tax benefits when they buy low-emission cars, and this is also a major reason why they don't consider low-emission cars.	7	12	20	report	statement
CCTV1_30MINNEWS_CMN_20080403_115901	0	275.966	290.241	speaker#11	male	native	It should be reflected in taxes, should be reflected. In fact, if it's not for commercial, for family use, it should be low-emission. The state's policy is mixed up -- road-maintenance fees, tolls, including the duties of environmental protection are the same for both large and small vehicles.	8	13	21	filler	statement
CCTV1_30MINNEWS_CMN_20080403_115901	0	275.966	290.241	speaker#6	male	native	Eh, road maintenance fees and tolls.	8	13	22	filler	statement

Nobody said that since the emission of your car is lower, and for a regular three-Yuan parking fee, I now charge you one Yuan instead. Nobody said that.	8	14	23	filler	statement
CCTV1_30MINNEWS_CMN_20080403_115901	0	301.044	314.397	speaker#4	male	native	In fact, in our country, we have taken the attitude of encouragement when it comes to the development of low-emission cars. In the contents of the guidance of industrial restructuring published at the end of 2005 by the National Development and Reform Commission, it listed that advanced economic model passenger cars with low emission as the encouraged category.	9	15	25	report	statement
CCTV1_30MINNEWS_CMN_20080403_115901	0	314.397	334.944	speaker#4	male	native	Early in 2006, the National Development and Reform Commission and other six ministerial commissions issued a joint opinion on encouraging the development of energy-saving, environmentally friendly, and low-emission vehicles and lifted bans in some cities where the use of low-emission vehicles had been banned. A senior analyst in the automotive industry, Jia Xinguang, believes that, although policies to encourage low-emission car have been introduced continually, they do not have specific implementation details.	9	15	26	report	statement
CCTV1_30MINNEWS_CMN_20080403_115901	0	334.944	371.748	Jia_Xin_Guang	male	native	For example, if you bought a low-emission car, you should in the purchase tax, eh, be motivated by the sales tax. In Japan, if you bought a light four-wheel vehicle, the minimum purchase tax is only 7,000 Japanese yen. If you buy a sedan with a capacity higher than 1.30, you need to pay 110,000 Japanese yen. So the difference is very obvious. For another example, say for parking, like this, eh, in the use of it, eh, do, do not impose any restriction, in this way, eh, this will encourage the development of low-emission vehicles.	9	16	27	report	statement
CCTV1_30MINNEWS_CMN_20080403_115901	0	371.748	391.173	speaker#14	male	native	Uh, for fuel tax, this should be introduced, to change the way the road maintenance fee is collected.

CCTV1_30MINNEWS_CMN_20080403_115901	0	391.173	401.309	speaker#2	male	native	Apart from the awkward situation of low-emission cars domestically, in the face of environmental pollution, the energy crisis, traffic jams, and other issues, low-emission cars are getting more and more popular among people within many other countries.	9	18	29	report	statement
CCTV1_30MINNEWS_CMN_20080403_115901	0	401.309	422.847	speaker#4	male	native	In recent years, small-size Japanese cars are getting more and more popular among ordinary people and the public sectors. Sales in the market are gradually getting better, the Japanese government is conducting differential tax policies on collection weight tax, car tax, and model tax on car consumptions; for small-size cars, its fuel usage, car insurance, or inspection fees are all lower than cars of other categories.	9	19	30	report	statement

Low-emission cars' advantages in environmental protection, energy-saving, and prices make them a consumption trend in the European car market. The best thing about low-emission cars is that they are easy to park, because it is a very difficult thing to find parking spaces in European cities.	9	19	31	report	statement

CCTV1_30MINNEWS_CMN_20080403_115901	0	507.712	537.111	speaker#1	female	native	When attending a hearing of the congressional joint economic committee, Bernanke stated that the growth rate of the U.S. GDP for the first half of this year may be very small, and may have even shrunk. However, if the real estate market and credit market tend to stabilize, and the recently implemented financial incentives promote consumer spending, the U.S. economy is expected to improve in the second half of this year. Bernanke did not specifically express an opinion about the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates in the future and he did not mention measures to stimulate economic growth either. Analysts believe this may suggest that the Fed will control the pace of lowering interest rates.	10	21	35	report	statement
