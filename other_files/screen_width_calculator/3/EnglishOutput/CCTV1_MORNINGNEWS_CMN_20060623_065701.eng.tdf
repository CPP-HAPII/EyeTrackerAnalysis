The title is "Delayed for Three Years and Still Not Completed, Half a City's Sewage Seeps into the Yangtze."	24	86	211	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2302.422	2316.626	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	It is talking about the Shenming dam sewage-treatment plant in the Three Gorges reservoir area. Actually it should have been built and put into operation in, um, June 2003. Handling 60,000 tonnes of sewage a day, but, er, its function is very important to the reservoir area.	24	86	212	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2316.626	2332.911	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	But as of today, there is not even a trace of the sewage-treatment plant. In Wanzhou urban district in Chongqing, half of the residential sewage is currently still discharged directly into the Yangtze River. And after some study, it turns out there are three main reasons for this. The first is that there has been inadequate planning for pollution prevention and control in order to speed up the rate of progress on the project and speedily put it into operation.	24	86	213	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2332.911	2349.244	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	And reckless construction work has touched off landslides and low-level faults, which is something worth thinking about. And control of these landslides has repeatedly failed, and the date for completion of the works has also been repeatedly put off. We want to say here that naturally, it is still better to complete engineering projects like this as early as possible, and that the relevant departments still need to speed up the work.	24	86	214	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2349.244	2367.058	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	A news report from the Shenzhen Commercial Daily says, "Child, you didn't come into this world for nothing." It refers to a young couple in Shenzhen, who gave birth to a boy just half a year ago. But very unfortunately, this boy got an incurable disease and sadly passed away just six months after coming into the world.	25	87	215	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2367.058	2384.763	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	The couple said that although the child lived to a very young age, they still hoped that he could make some contribution to the world. Hence, they decided to donate their own child's corneas, and the, er, donee is currently hurrying over to Shenzhen.	25	87	216	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2384.763	2403.829	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	The Peninsular City News has similarly related a very moving story about presenting home-made gratitude cards to people giving up their seats. A young lady named Zheng Mingming, who is 28 years old this year, sadly contracted +systemic +lupus +erythematosus last year and thereafter could only walk by holding onto a pair of crutches.	26	88	217	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2403.829	2411.904	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Because her family's financial circumstances were quite poor, she couldn't afford to go out by taxi, and could only choose to travel by bus.	26	88	218	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2411.904	2425.072	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Er, what really moved her was that every time she took the bus, there were many kind-hearted people who gave up their seats to her. She felt both grateful and guilty about this, because she thought she was only 28 years old, and this should be a time for her to make greater contributions to society.	26	88	219	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2425.072	2437.470	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	In order to express her own gratitude and conscience, she, er, personally made many gratitude cards, and altogether made more than 70 of them, and gave out more than 50 of them over a period of half a year.	26	88	220	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2437.470	2459.500	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Some of these cards were square, and some were rhomboid in shape. She would write on them, write many words of her true feelings, for example, "Thank you for your help," and "Your help made me feel really warm." I think her way of presenting her compassion will also have made more people who are willing to help others offer their own compassion more often and more willing to help others.	26	88	221	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2459.500	2470.485	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	The Xinhua Daily Telegraph has carried a report on whether government expenditure is becoming too absurd when public funds are used to provide handsome rewards for students of famous universities.	27	89	222	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2470.485	2486.441	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	It says that township governments in Dongguan city, Guangdong, are giving an award of 500,000 yuan as incentives to each of the students who have been admitted into Tsinghua and Peking Universities, and are awarding sums from 10,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan to some other students.	27	89	223	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2486.441	2502.261	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Well, the arrangement of these awards ranging from 3,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan appears to be the government's effort to promote the development of local education, but in fact this money is public funds. Who on earth gave the government the, um, authority to use these public funds just as they please?	27	89	224	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2502.261	2516.567	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	The article says that the problem is that the way financial administration is run lacks the required openness, rigor and transparency, and the government is spending money in an aimless manner and often allocating it casually in line with the temperament of leaders, resulting in this phenomenon of spending public funds on rewarding students of famous universities.	27	89	225	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2516.567	2539.531	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Furthermore, lying behind the casual government spending of money is also the faulty, faulty education -- the concept of political performance at work. It is a unilateral seeking of quality and a mere superficial effort to pursue short-term economic benefits; and this policy of handsome rewards is of no benefit to the students either. It can only further encourage them in the blind thinking that you must get high scores to get money and must get high scores to lead an interesting life.	27	89	226	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2539.531	2544.814	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	We hope this phenomenon will not reoccur in other areas.	27	89	227	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2544.814	2563.025	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Now that the college entrance exams are over, um, many of the examinees will be going traveling one after another, but people have probably forgotten, forgotten to notice another group, that is, that there any many university students who are currently facing, um, graduation. And how are they taking their leave of their own college lives?	28	90	228	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2563.025	2578.631	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Before, when I was at university, I might invite my teachers for a meal, or hold a party with my fellow students, yeah, but the current university students are different. They have chosen to go traveling as a way of saying good-bye to university life. This is a report from the China Youth Daily.	28	90	229	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2578.631	2584.549	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	In fact, going traveling can be said to be a very good, um, way of handling this.	28	90	230	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2584.549	2597.836	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Nowadays, ((pw)) students are really very smart. By going abroad for a trip with a tour group, you can not only consolidate your friendship with your fellow students, but also widen your own experiences, and at the same time leave behind many beautiful memories.	28	90	231	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2597.836	2611.243	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Speaking of traveling, er, which tourist route in the country is currently taking off? I think many viewer friends haven't probably actually thought about it. Let me suggest one for you here, and that is the, um, tourist route along the Qinghai-Tibet railroad.	28	90	232	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2611.243	2617.620	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Let's take a look at the Southern Metropolitan Daily, which said that the first eight-day trip along the Qinghai-Tibet railroad costs 6,900 yuan.	29	91	233	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2617.620	2624.331	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Just by looking at the title, er, you may not fully understand. In fact, it is a price estimated by the various large tourist agencies for this trip along the Qinghai-Tibet railroad.	29	91	234	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2624.331	2628.343	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	A price of 6,900 yuan is really not cheap -- it is enough for us to go on a trip abroad.	29	91	235	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2628.343	2639.172	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	It can be seen how popular this Qinghai-Tibet railroad tourist route is, and let me mention in passing that the Qinghai-Tibet railroad will formally open on July 1.	29	91	236	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2639.172	2647.641	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Reading this news, I could not help feeling a little indignant. A report from the +Jinghua Times says that an elementary school student has been beaten deaf by his teacher.	30	92	237	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2647.641	2653.375	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	This is something that took place in an elementary school for the children of migrant workers in the Changping district of Beijing Municipality.	30	92	238	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2653.375	2662.375	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	There was a boy called Little Di, who is only 12 years old this year. His companion complained to the teacher about him because of a quarrel that took place when he was, er, playing a game together with his companion.	30	92	239	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2662.375	2666.574	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	But the teacher, instead of handling properly this matter, actually boxed Little Di on the ears.	30	92	240	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2666.574	2676.089	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Little Di was hit so hard that he felt quite dizzy at the moment. After going to hospital for +treatment, it was determined that he had neural deafness.	30	92	241	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2676.089	2688.647	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	So, what was the stance of the school towards this? The +school said that for the moment it would not expel the teacher who beat the child. I think the school's way of handling this is not right either. They should give the teacher some warning.	30	92	242	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2688.647	2698.788	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	And the teacher has actually not acknowledged this conduct of his. The teacher said that in fact he had done this also to teach the child. It was in order to uphold discipline in the school.	30	92	243	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2698.788	2704.395	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	It is not difficult for us to imagine that this act by the teacher not only harmed Little Di, his young body,	30	92	244	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2704.395	2712.832	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	more importantly, it cast a shadow over his psychology, because he is only 12 years old this year. Could there really have been no better way? There must have been.	30	92	245	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2712.832	2717.823					30	93	246	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2717.823	2726.121	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Okay.

If you eat them raw, then it is very difficult to absorb it ((pw)) well.	31	94	252	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2777.183	2796.071	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	Those foods ((pw)) relatively high in starch content, like potatoes, ah, taros, ah, and Chinese yams, are also suitable to be eaten cooked. In addition, foods like lentils need to be cooked 100% before they are eaten. Then, and, er, there is a lot of pesticide, um, left on vegetables, and you need to soak them in brine first.	31	94	253	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060623_065701	0	2796.071	2804.818	Li_Zi_Meng	female	native	So those were today's tips for everyday life, and that's all for Media Square as well.
