Now that the grades of the National College Entrance Examination had come out, there are two choices for candidates whose grades were unsatisfactory or who, uh, failed the examination. One is to choose to repeat the grade and the other is to choose to study abroad.	21	79	181	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2194.316	2204.824	Zi_Meng	female	native	Candidates who choose to repeat the grade have brought about a new economic phenomenon called post-examination economy. Let's look at the analysis of the China Industrial Economy News.	21	79	182	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2204.824	2224.785	Zi_Meng	female	native	It said, for instance, in Beijing area, if a candidate needs to repeat the grade, his tuition fees will be between 13,000 to 17,000 yuan a year.

The phenomenon of seeking instant benefits inevitably happens in some schools. They lie about having high university entrance rate and high passing rate to attract student source.	21	79	185	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2254.673	2273.721	Zi_Meng	female	native	Yet, many of, uh, the teachers are indeed part-time teachers. In addition, many of them are retired teachers from key schools. As a result, it brings about a problem, which is, they may not have enough understanding of each year's new curriculum and formats of the National College Entrance Examination, thus affecting students' further education again.	21	79	186	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2273.721	2298.561	Zi_Meng	female	native	Well, uh, the Yangtze Nightly had also shown concern for this information today. What it said was that there would be 40,000 National College Entrance Examination repeaters across Jiangsu Province this year. Some of the repeaters belonged to a very special group, which was, university students who quit school on their own accord in order to repeat the grade. It was thought provoking.	21	79	187	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2298.561	2311.111	Zi_Meng	female	native	There are two main reasons for university students to quit school and repeat the grade. One is that their results in the National College Entrance Examination in those years might not be satisfactory enough and the schools they chose made them think that they were too far from their original ideal. As a result, they return to high school to take the examination again.	21	79	188	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2311.111	2329.979	Zi_Meng	female	native	Another one is that they made an imperfect choice when selecting their majors and they believed that these choices were not suitable for them. Thus, they also return to high school to retake the examination. Here, I also want to remind candidates who are preparing to fill out their choices that you must consider thoroughly when you fill out your choices and do not repeat high school when you are already in university.	21	79	189	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2329.979	2346.746	Zi_Meng	female	native	Well, I believe that the, uh, post-examination economy that we mentioned earlier has also exposed some problems. I think relevant departments should also step up supervision of, uh, the post-examination economy in order to prevent it from becoming a blind spot of our educational system.	21	79	190	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2346.746	2354.559	Zi_Meng	female	native	In addition, the Shanxi Nightly, ah, said that, er, uh, 3,000 graduates had no choice but to engage in frenzied consumption.

However, they still have a few hundred yuan in their meal card that they cannot withdraw. They hope that they can have the money refunded before they graduate.

I feel very sad when I see such tree felling behavior. However, many relevant departments seem to turn a blind eye to the action of felling tree indeed. Yet, Shanghai had imposed heavy punishment on this act.	21	79	196	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2422.604	2427.854	Zi_Meng	female	native	Let's watch the detailed report.	21	79	197	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2427.854	2436.053	Zi_Meng	female	native	Uh, er, ((pw)), the unit that was heavily punished was the Electrification Company under the China CREC Railway Electrification Bureau Group.	21	79	198	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2436.053	2457.832	Zi_Meng	female	native	It was because they, uh, used the excuse of ensuring the safety along the line of electric trains to cut down the, uh, landscape along the line in large quantities without approval. The amount of their heavy fine was also quite huge. They were fined 369,000 yuan. In addition, the person who was directly responsible was also fined 5,000 yuan.	21	79	199	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2457.832	2470.091	Zi_Meng	female	native	There was another issue, that is, during the entire handling of the matter, the government's response was very quick.

The article said that in the face of the low efficiency in urban management nowadays, the quick handling of the destruction of trees incident had taught us a vivid lesson.	21	79	201	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2490.366	2506.012	Zi_Meng	female	native	The China Woman's News: A female doctor made a handbook for medication prices herself to save money for patients.

In addition, the number of patients it sees also leads the same type of hospitals in the province. We also hope that this kind of doctor and such hospital will become more and more.	21	79	204	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2548.724	2553.912	Zi_Meng	female	native	What the Life Times concerned about was who should pay when children go see a doctor.	21	79	205	report	CCTV1_MORNINGNEWS_CMN_20060630_065701	0	2553.912	2572.044	Zi_Meng	female	native	For us adults, if we visited a doctor, there was free medical care in the past.
