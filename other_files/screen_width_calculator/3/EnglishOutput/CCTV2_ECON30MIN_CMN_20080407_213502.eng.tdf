This fluent Chinese leads him to a deeper understanding about the relationship between China and Australia. I have noticed that when he first took office, he said that it was necessary to develop a 50-year China-Australia strategic plan. Notice that it is 50 years -- half a century. The focus is to stress the complementary economic relations between China and Australia, particularly to develop cooperation in areas of financial services, biotechnology, and clean energy. Now, this person who knows China so well is coming to Beijing soon to start his first trip to China as Australia's prime minister. Let us take a look together.	1	3	6	report	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	359.345	385.530	speaker#2	male	native	I had the privilege to know Kevin Rudd several years ago, while he was still an ordinary member of Congress.

Earlier, we understood the itinerary and purposes of Kevin Rudd's visit to China. As mentioned earlier, Australia is a country sitting on a tramcar. Besides rich resources of coal, Australia is also very rich in iron ore resources, with exploitable reserves of more than 13 billion tons, ranking fourth in the world, and its iron ore export is the world's second highest.	9	12	27	filler	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	818.484	843.728	Rui_Cheng_Gang	male	native	In 2007, 39.51% of China's iron ore imports were from Australia. With the prices of iron ore soaring continually in recent years, Sino-Australian iron ore talks, Sino-Australian free trade talks are issues that have become hot spots of the two countries' economic and trade relations. I also asked Kevin Rudd, as the new leader of Australia, how he sees these changes in economic and trade relations between the two countries.	9	12	29	filler	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	843.728	876.012	speaker#4	male	native	Entering 2008, prices of international iron have increased by 65%, and the production costs per ton of iron in China has gone up by 400 Yuan while the iron and steel enterprises feel the great pressure. In such a grim situation, negotiations between China and Australia regarding iron ore have been particularly difficult. According to established practices, the annual Sino-Australian iron ore negotiations end in early April, but this year, as there are differences between Australia as a supplier and China as a demander, the Sino-Australian iron ore talks have not yet reached a price for the new fiscal year.	10	13	31	report	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	876.012	892.924	Rui_Cheng_Gang	male	native	You have just mentioned cooperation in the area of energy. The problem is that prices of Australian iron ore have gone up so rapidly in the last two years. They have an annual increase of 70 to 80% each year. For this, some of our Chinese entrepreneurs feel great pressure. I don't know how you see this issue of prices.	11	14	32	filler	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	892.924	930.187	Lu_Ke_Wen	male	native	Uh, this is an issue of the market. Sometimes, this, eh, this supplier country gets the benefit, eh, sometimes, the import country is benefited. Eh, I hope that our two countries, including the companies of our two countries, the Chinese enterprises of iron and steel and our iron and steel companies can further develop their long-term cooperation relations. I would like to protect the history of these close relations, and prepare for further cooperation.	11	14	35	filler	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	930.187	952.007	speaker#4	male	native	In addition to the Sino-Australian iron ore negotiations, free trade negotiations are also an issue of mutual concern between Australia and China. Earlier this year, when China's iron and steel enterprises prepared to buy a 9% stake from Australian's mining company, Rio Tinto, Australia introduced a more stringent investment policy, which was once considered to target China.	12	15	36	report	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	952.007	981.795	Rui_Cheng_Gang	male	native	In China, eh, some people say that, eh, they say that the foreign investment bills passed in Australia recently are targeting China. They were restricting some Chinese enterprises from investing in Australia. However, the fact is that more than 2,000 people collectively wrote from Bonn, a city in Queensland state, to welcome the Chinese tourism industry, China Travel Services, to invest there, the letter was very sincere. I Think I don't know whether such a joint letter is a way to represent the attitude of the vast Australian people as well as the Australian Government toward China's investment.	13	16	37	filler	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	981.795	1022.146	Lu_Ke_Wen	male	native	Historically, Australia has always welcomed foreign investment. History, eh, since the 19th century, eh, we have been relying on foreign investment to help, eh, our national economic development.

In fact, before entering the Parliament in 1998, Kevin Rudd was a diplomat and senior officer in Queensland state and at the same time, he was also a consultant assisting Australian companies to establish business contacts with China. Therefore, he is quite experienced in Sino-Australian enterprise cooperation.	14	17	41	report	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	1042.637	1062.681	Rui_Cheng_Gang	male	native	Well, I think, eh, though you are Prime Minister now, what recommendations would you give Chinese enterprises to better enter Australia?	15	18	42	filler	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	1042.637	1062.681	Lu_Ke_Wen	male	native	I think it's about the same as in China that the best way is to make good arrangements for a domestic partner, that is, Chinese investors come here and find a domestic business partner in Australia. I think that is a very good way to do it.	15	18	43	filler	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	1062.681	1084.153	speaker#4	male	native	Based on his deep understanding of China, Kevin Rudd has been holding the China card high. He has said that China and Australia are strongly economically complementary to each other. At present, China has become Australia's largest trading partner. In 2007, the volume of trade between the two countries has exceeded 40 billion U.S. dollars. In order to further promote cooperation between the two sides, Kevin Rudd said that there will be a long-term strategy for China and Australia.	16	19	44	report	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	1084.153	1103.225	Rui_Cheng_Gang	male	native	Well, I remember you, eh, when you campaigned for the office of Prime Minister, someone told me that you mentioned in your speech that if you become the Prime Minister, you would establish a strategy with China for as long as 50 years.

Eh, of course, eh, I would say my party has just won the election in our country, now I have a new opportunity to manifest this concept, to implement it. Therefore, this visit will give me a specific, concrete opportunity to carry out this concept. Eh, we should bring this trading relation of ours one step forward, eh, bring the scope of economic cooperation, bring this scope, how should I say it, make it more widespread.	17	20	48	filler	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	1286.609	1327.708	Rui_Cheng_Gang	male	native	Welcome back to our program. We have just watched Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who is talking about a 50-year strategic vision while he has just assumed the office. His set up of such a long-term goal is not just as a political card. Kevin Rudd has lived in China for a long period of time while he was a diplomat there and he has a profound understanding of Chinese society and the country. Eh, after he entered into business, he personally participated in the Sino-Australian economic cooperation, and has a clear understanding of the economic and trade relations between the two economic powers. So, in his mind, what strategic positions would China and Australia take in global economy from now on -- let's listen to Prime Minister Rudd's ideas.	19	22	50	report	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080407_213502	0	1327.708	1348.748	speaker#4	male	native	The Chief economist of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group has said that Australia has gained tremendous benefits from the economic development of China and the world.

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd gives such an orientation to Sino-Australian economic and trade relations. Kevin Rudd has stated in a speech that his study about China has started since 1976. He has studied Deng Xiaoping's Theory with classmates, and has studied China's economic system reforms. It can be said that Kevin Rudd's bond with China has gone far beyond a general curiosity and surprise of a person from the West.
