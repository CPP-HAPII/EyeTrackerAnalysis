Of course, they did not say it directly. However, ordinary people understood the meaning of their statement. That was, we would care less about human rights in China. We would compete for more businesses. Yes, this would bring monetary benefits to us. Our economy was poor, right? Many ordinary people perhaps would then tolerate, thinking that perhaps what, what you did made sense.	2	25	175	report	statementVOA_FOCUSDIALOGUE_CMN_20080406_160500	0	1336.569	1349.707	Wei_Jing_Sheng	male	native	However, in fact, you had not shown concern over human rights, you had not gained much business either, only that much.
