I'm sure that, throughout this afternoon's live broadcast, Quan Ling will bring us more details about this at any time.	2	10	29	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	908.187	931.355	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	Um {cough} I should put it this way. Um, in '03, um, when institutional reform was proposed, ah, our country, um, actually we can see in retrospect, we had already passed through some troubled times, right? Including, this financial, um, storm, ah, these troubled times. Then, at the same time as this there was also, um, a major development in our domestic, um, development. There was unprecedented accumulation, and there was also a deepening of people's understanding of a great many issues.	4	19	73	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	1003.670	1027.287	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	{cough} From my personal perspective, you can see it from two, two sides. One is the domestic side. I just said that we've gone through thirty years of development, and we actually should have made historical progress. We have already reached a considerable level in our understanding of many issues. Right now we have, have a definite ((pw)), or we have, have considerable self-confidence. We can construct many things that have special Chinese characteristics. And this thing we can change to be more and more self-confident, have a stronger and stronger grasp.	4	19	83	filler	CCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	1761.105	1763.366	speaker#1	male	native	Okay, thank you very much Quan Ling for bringing us that report.	5	31	148	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	1794.368	1819.904	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	Several {cough}. This is a provision of principle in the report of the Seventeenth National People's Congress. Then, regarding this pairing relationship of foundational and upper level economic construction, this, er, has been repeated many times in the reports of both the Sixteenth and Seventeenth National People's Congresses. That's also, also to say that there's also a phrase in this period's opinion regarding deepening the reform of administrative oversight systems. I don't know, er, if you have been aware of it or not.	5	32	150	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	2096.000	2111.144	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	Then we suddenly discovered that, in this report of the Seventeenth National People's Congress, um, we suddenly discovered that in the report of the Seventeenth National People's Congress, there was actually a classic, um, a statement, which is that development depends on the people. Um, that (()) that phrase, ((pw)) the last sentence, as well, everyone enjoys the achievements of reform.	5	38	167	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	2281.960	2299.738	speaker#13	male	native	What I hope for, uh, in government at each level, um, (()) is to have, um, implementation in the area of public establishment, should implement electronic government and online processing as quickly as possible. This is a means of energy conservation and reducing emissions. The time you spend going to offices is less, is shorter. Um, you naturally use your car less, so it reduces emissions.	6	45	177	report	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	2675.919	2678.237	speaker#1	male	native	Okay, thank you Quan Ling for bringing us that report.	7	55	202	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	2990.851	3018.085	speaker#1	male	native	The Ministry of Agriculture, the Forestry Administration, they want to spend (()) door is difficult to enter.	7	66	223	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	3075.112	3086.675	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	Yes, {cough} internationally, there are times when you use an ((pw)), an index. This is a soft index. It's a citizens, um, happiness ((pw)), happiness index. The happiness index can be used to measure the problem we were just discussing. You, it's your feeling inside.	7	66	232	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	3586.194	3604.157	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	This is, this is, this is, er, er, an important experience of developed Western countries in these years. If they're too specialized, then you actually can't divide them up clearly, because the more specialized you are, it's almost a, a, ((pw)) ((pw)) ((pw)) ((pw)), a state of limitless potential division. Then because of this adopting a type of relatively broad style of composition, it could be more beneficial to dividing work with certainty.	7	73	274	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	3636.939	3650.526	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	Um, I think that in this Seventeenth National People's Congress Report there is a very clear, a, a, a, a logical composition. At the beginning (()) this issue you mentioned, actually there is already an, an, a response method forecasted.	7	73	278	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	3675.993	3698.023	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	This Seventeenth National People's Congress report used very clear language and made an explanation of this point, yes, it is about what we've said about the so-called five major, five major oversight systems, ah, five major oversight systems, (()) a cooperation.	7	73	282	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	3832.037	3849.222	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	This {cough} implementation was smooth. The low effect of the implementation, it's even no effect under certain conditions, and it could even have a counter effect under certain special conditions. In the recent several years in our country, this, er, you should say, is a type of administrative phenomenon that no one is willing to see. It definitely commonly exists.	7	73	298	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	4050.684	4086.249	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	I'll give you an example. It's like this {cough}, um mining disasters in China. The whole country is paying attention to this, the whole world is also paying attention. This problem actually has been unsolvable for a long time. In addition to that it has a very complex reason, there's still a problem. Actually back when this policy was under discussion, or it was in commentary by the media, I actually also expressed similar opinion.	7	73	318	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	4121.887	4143.019	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	So in a new time, when we do this type of unprecedented undertaking, when we make this type of very large scale, um deep reform of the administrative oversight system, there definitely needs to be the formation of a consensus on all sides. {cough} Then on the basis of consensus, you can handle it in collaboration. Then this problem, I think only then can we finally reach all the goals that we hope for.	7	73	324	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	4167.714	4190.852	speaker#1	male	native	But if they don't go, ah, it will be also tough, because there were certainly a lot of these types of mining disasters. Because the national office didn't go, it was not possible to remove this cover. Many incidents were obviously covered up. For example, I've asked the then-vice chief of the State Administration of Work Safety, the Shanxi (()) mine disaster, I asked him how did you learn of this news? He said I learned about it on the Internet.	7	74	327	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	4409.823	4413.900	speaker#1	male	native	Okay, thank you very much Quan Ling, for bringing us an introduction about this aspect, thank you.	7	77	343	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	4454.639	4475.409	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	This {cough} macro department, um, you should understand it like this. This is according to my individual perspective. This National Development and Reform Commission is what the national authorities call one of the macro regulation departments. So its status is very important. That goes without saying. But in these years, um, in the practice of the past several years, we can ((pw)), can really notice a phenomenon.	7	78	347	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	4501.449	4518.812	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	Right. {cough} This was talking about the NDRC. Then the issue of coordination in several other bureaus, ah, ah, the Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, etcetera, these several, right, er, their function changes. So the name of the institution didn't change, but changes have occurred in +its function, that is, one of them, I think, um, it could be a problem of coordination among their ministries.	7	80	352	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	4561.903	4601.809	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	Then according to my individual speculation, behind this type of strengthening of mechanisms of coordination, it should be rising to ((pw)) the next level. My individual speculation, um, on ((pw)), on top of this, there should be dividing of duties by the State Council as a major leader. There may also be a type of suitable adjustment in response to the change that we were just discussing. For example, um, macro regulation, there is a strong possibility that there will need to be a premier, er, a vice premier in charge to manage the affair. Otherwise this type of {cough} strong, um, mechanism of coordination will not take shape, yes.	7	80	358	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	4670.951	4678.490	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	{cough} This problem of power supply in China, ah, to use my individual understanding, should be an extremely complex problem.	7	82	365	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	4724.543	4742.142	speaker#1	male	native	Yes, it's called a mechanism of high-level idea coordination. The idea is to discuss important affairs. Coordination could enable several related ministries at the very least to unify. At the same time it has to be high-level, to make it have definite, um, ((pw)) ((pw)) authority.	7	83	370	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	5316.415	5337.715	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	Yes.	7	96	420	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	5564.584	5568.411	speaker#1	male	native	Okay, thank you very much Quan Ling for bringing us that on-site report. Thank you.	7	101	439	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	5594.680	5628.696	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	{cough}, This issue of environmental protection, we all know that in the recent, er, several years it's been a major policy issue. And after the raising of this major governmental issue, we have repeatedly raised many important governmental goals, but the process of realizing this, these policy goals, um, including government, and also including Chinese people of all levels, probably cannot be too satisfied. I should say that the distance from what we imagined, um, or from the level that we demanded, is still not small.	7	103	443	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	6168.428	6193.103	speaker#1	male	native	Right, (()).	7	108	484	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	6219.478	6251.299	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	Um {cough}, um, according to the central government, er, um, administration, from the goal of administrating, my individual perspective, earlier I already spoke about this idea. Right now we should establish five administrative branches of government. Actually, what do we need to do? We need to establish five administrative branches of government.	7	108	489	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	6330.311	6362.012	speaker#1	male	native	It became more refined, clear, just like the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Development {laugh}. Just then you were very clear, yes, yes, correct, correct.	7	108	498	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	6362.012	6379.281	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	Yes {cough}.	7	108	501	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	6420.252	6439.408	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	Um {cough} he is talking about two ministries. I also think, I should say that it's two, ((pw)), two types of ministries. One type acted, one type didn't act. In the one that didn't act, there exists furthering the transformation of functions. In this party document, in the Seventeenth National People's Congress report, it clearly proposed that the government's function transform. It's not there yet. So this government's, uh, interference is excessive, which is the problem clearly raised this time.	7	110	505	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	6502.285	6508.326	speaker#1	male	native	Final words. I just said, more effectively provide public goods. {laugh} Didn't you use this word moments ago?	7	112	510	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	6567.228	6589.508	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	{cough} This section, this statement, I should say, is for ah, the past several years, the government continuously summarizes experience. This society is also continuously rethinking these issues. Integrated together, I should say it's a very good amalgamation of wisdom, this type of a, a, a, a classic important statement that amalgamates, um, uh, er, opinions from officials from, um, all levels and regions of government.	7	113	517	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	6589.508	6613.843	Zhang_Guo_Qing	male	native	Then in this section of statement, it has taken problems that may arise and made in advance a, ah, a principled restatement {cough} of national resources, yes.	7	113	519	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	6769.366	6798.919	speaker#22	male	native	Right, er, I'm from Hubei. The State Council's plan for institutional reform was a decision of reform and opening. It is also an important element of reform of the political system. Even more important is the government's implementation of self transformation. Er, being, if I were acting as a representative, I'd be very excited and hopeful about the State Council's institutional reform plan, (()).	7	116	534	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	6954.252	6956.138	speaker#1	male	native	Okay. Thank you very much Quan Ling for bringing us that report.	7	121	548	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	7261.811	7277.763	speaker#1	male	native	Professor Zhang, the ball's been kicked to you {laugh}.	7	125	573	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	7513.530	7529.476	speaker#1	male	native	I guess that while they are still struggling to be fast, they should be faster, because next step, the work still needs (()), right, unlimited time, correct.	7	127	595	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	7946.686	7963.716	Zhang_Quan_ling	female	native	Then management and administration, separate management and administration, right, (()) then only when it's like this can the efficiency of our government ministries increase. Otherwise, there are many affairs that if you manage too minutely, manage too much, then you're making it too hard on yourself, it's too tiresome. In addition, there are some things that are very hard to handle well.	7	133	633	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	7978.291	8008.271	speaker#27	male	native	{laugh} Er, as for what specific time, what I say does not count, but I expect, er, two, these issues to deepen a step further. One is giving shape to a genuine major energy institution. Regarding our country's formation of a strong energy development strategy, preserving citizens' economic continuity, er, sustainable development is incredibly important.	7	134	638	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	8060.732	8063.906	speaker#1	male	native	Okay, thank you very much Quan Ling for bringing us that report.	7	135	643	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLESCONGRESS2_CMN_20080311_122701	0	8363.042	8387.243	speaker#30	male	native	But, um, we also realize that this reform of governmental system in reality we are also (()), but the general direction of reform is towards reducing ministries and simplifying, um, staff, to increase efficiency. There is movement in this direction, but our, um, management costs, management achievements, er, management details, er, there has been a feeling that they're still too complicated or too many, and also too high. There has also been a lot of discussion of this in society.	8	142	664	report	statement
