I just heard the esteemed guest, when he was talking about Ma Ying-jeou and nationalism, that he shouldn't talk about, um, democracy or redressingthe Tiananmen issue. I think that if Ma Ying-jeou, if he moves forward (()) should not become independent, and can't talk about issues of democracy and human rights and freedom with the CCP, then it's just like he's finished with the Communist Party, has abandoned his own principles and has nothing left. This is the first thing.
