Dropped in my mouth, took a drink of water and that was it. Generally speaking, a lot of mistakes in taking the medicine were brought about like this, putting it in the mouth, drinking some water, swallowing it, and it was settled. And there wasn't any type of medicinal flavor. Why shouldn't you break this medicine into smaller bits? Why do you make it so big? If you break one piece into four or five pieces then what's the problem? You should eat it like this. Why did you make it so big?	2	24	26	filler	statement
