VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	721.538	731.767	Lin_Sen	male	native	The honorable guest we've invited to our studio today is Ms. (()), researcher at (()) Research Center, a Washington research institution.	6	20	85	report	statement
VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	731.767	736.767	Lin_Sen	male	native	Ms. (()) will be speaking English on the program; what you'll hear is the voice of a simultaneous interpreter.	6	20	86	report	statement
VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	1411.444	1419.835	speaker#21	male	native	Although this, China's, this, economy is not as developed as Japan's, this -- this optimism index for the Chinese people, and this (()), this spiritual and cultural life of Chinese people is absolutely stronger than Japanese people's.	11	43	138	nontrans	statement
VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	1860.402	1877.555	speaker#22	male	native	Uh, I've just been listening to the opinions of several listeners and viewers, and I also {cough} now I'd also like to say a bit about my view, uh, that is, uh, since China and Japan established relations, diplomatic relations, uh, that is (()).	11	49	164	nontrans	statement
VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	1884.208	1884.849	speaker#23	male	native	Hello.	11	51	166	nontrans	statement
VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	1981.351	1998.883	speaker#24	male	native	Modern ((pw)), uh, Japanese society is now developing very normally, like a normal country, so we can't look at Japan any more through the tinted glasses we had before -- still, still, Japanese fascism has gripped every social class, or whatever. This phenomenon doesn't exist any more, basically, this (()) basis of their society is already gone.	11	56	178	nontrans	statement
VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	1998.883	2016.543	speaker#24	male	native	So I think the local propaganda efforts of the Chinese government, ah, are too powerful. It always focuses on this past stigma of Japan and doesn't let go; it's made the entire Chinese people, ah, this, very narrow, very narrow-minded. At the mere mention of Japan, they will hate its guts. I think this is bad; it's bad for the future development of China -- China and Japan (()) China and Japan.	11	56	179	nontrans	statement
VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	2130.535	2143.553	speaker#10	female	native	I (()) there seems to be a listener from ((pw)) - Shandong just now, uh, who mentioned what his child thinks about when talking about Japan. He was maybe saying that this might have something to do with this thing they teach at school.	11	59	188	nontrans	statement
VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	2300.049	2323.432	speaker#10	female	native	Because even though the Japanese government hasn't officially given compensation for the war, as you just said, uh, it certainly has already provided a huge amount of economic aid to China, to Korea. There are a lot of these kinds of ((pw)) ((pw)) agreements, oh, on economic cooperation that were made after it signed this kind of, uh, normalization of relations treaties with these countries.	11	59	196	nontrans	statement
VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	2397.635	2410.859	speaker#26	male	native	Uh, I was listening to the last few viewers just now, that is, talking about one issue, because I'm quite young, but from the older generation -- because I, this, (()), actually, I think, that is to say, Japan actually played a very ignoble role in the first half of China's modern history.	11	64	203	nontrans	statement
VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	2441.316	2459.076	speaker#26	male	native	The key issue is that in Japan now there are a lot of opinions that seem to say that "I've already given you, given you money." In terms of justice and conscience, they're not affected by any of this (()) from history, so their reflections, ah, on the war and on the +series of horrific crimes committed in China, ah, their reflections are definitely not as honest as those of Germans.	11	64	207	nontrans	statement
VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	2702.466	2735.265	speaker#10	female	native	But speaking of official government actions, uh, they already did in '93 or '94, there was already a formal statement of apology. Therefore, it was said, prime ministers in the future may have the situation, maybe if this, the circumstances are appropriate, they might express some -- some apologies on a personal level. But I think, uh, on the official level, uh, it's unlikely there could be more series of these kinds of apologies, because I think one-time official apology made by one government -- one administration, uh, is already enough.	13	70	223	report	statement
VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	2954.623	2980.818	speaker#10	female	native	But certainly (()) that is, the current situation is very unfortunate, so now let me go back to what we were saying before, uh, for the issue of misunderstanding, I hope it can be eased off to a certain extent.	15	82	243	report	statement
VOA_ISSUESANDOPINIONS_CMN_20080415_210500	0	3173.815	3194.406	Fan_Dong_Ning	female	native	Every year thousands of defectors from North Korea risk their life to escape poverty and oppression of (()), and flee to China. This is a long and hard journey, but VOA reporter Ramirez has made an in-depth report, accompanying these North Korean refugees from the North Korea-China border all the way to Thailand. Next is the first +item in this series of reports.	17	97	270	report	statement
