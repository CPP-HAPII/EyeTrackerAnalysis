Relevant Officials from the National Development and Reform Commission stated today that raising the minimum purchasing prices of foodstuffs has very little direct influence on the level of increase in consumer prices.	5	11	27	report	statementCCTVNEWS_EVENINGNEWS_CMN_20080330_225702	0	686.449	706.596	speaker#3	female	native	Since the beginning of this year, the nation has raised the minimum purchasing prices of foodstuffs twice.

This, the reason for this dispute between them mostly lies in, uh, America, it wants to, uh, insist on doing things its own way and persist in deploying this anti-missile system and wants to expand its anti-missile system around the world. So even though Russia has protested, America, since it pulled out of that anti-missile treaty, uh, starting from that time, uh, it has no longer seen this Russia as a competitive opponent, and it does not really want to look after that Russia's security relationship.	8	17	47	report	statementCCTVNEWS_EVENINGNEWS_CMN_20080330_225702	0	1068.699	1082.442	speaker#6	male	native	From the Star Wars back then to the current missile defense system that has been called the spawn of Star Wars, we have seen that over these 25 years this dispute over the dichotomy of the missile offense and missile defense has turned into a knot that cannot be untied entangling American relations.	8	19	49	report	statementCCTVNEWS_EVENINGNEWS_CMN_20080330_225702	0	1082.442	1093.131	speaker#6	male	native	And from the Star Wars back then until the missile defense system of today, America's persistent pursuit after a kind of strategic advantage that cannot be threatened could possibly be the main reason for causing all of this.	8	19	50	report	statementCCTVNEWS_EVENINGNEWS_CMN_20080330_225702	0	1093.131	1105.287	speaker#7	male	native	On March 23, 1983, the then American President Reagan said in an impassioned speech that America would step up the research and development and deployment of space age superweapons.	8	20	51	report	statementCCTVNEWS_EVENINGNEWS_CMN_20080330_225702	0	1105.287	1116.095	speaker#7	male	native	This was quickly described vividly as the Star Wars Program by American news circles. The emergence of Star Wars was a double result of the development of anti-missile technology and changes in America's policies.	8	20	52	report	statementCCTVNEWS_EVENINGNEWS_CMN_20080330_225702	0	1116.095	1133.787	speaker#7	male	native	Anti-ballistic missiles attack incoming enemy ballistic missiles. As military units were extensively equipped with ballistic missiles during the 1950s of last century, American and Soviet cities both became =targets of the opposing side's attacks and its hostages. Approval of ballistic missiles hence became the focus of the two powers' research and development of strategic weapons.	8	20	53	report	statementCCTVNEWS_EVENINGNEWS_CMN_20080330_225702	0	1158.381	1183.877	speaker#9	male	native	The true nature of the Star Wars Program is just, uh, to =ambitiously bring forth a kind of this so-called program of deploying a space-based interception system. It can use, for example, this kind of kinetic energy of space, uh, including, oh, what we called this kind of, uh, (()) these, uh, technologies, uh, to effectively =destroy and intercept, uh, this ballistic missile warhead, uh, that is flying in space.	8	21	55	report	statementCCTVNEWS_EVENINGNEWS_CMN_20080330_225702	0	1183.877	1200.015	speaker#7	male	native	After launching the Star Wars Program, America put in tens of billions of US dollars to carry out multiple cooperative research projects with Europe, Japan, and others. However, because most weapons in the program exceeded the technological level of the time, they were never able to develop a weapon system that could be (()).	8	22	56	report	statementCCTVNEWS_EVENINGNEWS_CMN_20080330_225702	0	1200.015	1228.134	speaker#9	male	native	Uh, after the Reagan administration ended, and along with the Bush Senior's administration taking office, the cold war quickly ended. So for America, it already did not have this, this enormous strategic and political need, uh, to make large-scale investments to carry out this kind of, uh, this =ambitious Star Wars Program. So later during the Bush Senior era, in fact the Star, the original Reagan version of Star Wars, uh, Program had already suffered vast cut-backs and this shrinkage.	8	23	57	report	statementCCTVNEWS_EVENINGNEWS_CMN_20080330_225702	0	1228.134	1241.963	speaker#9	male	native	So, what was left over from passing through the Clinton era was this missile interception program that was believed to be technologically feasible and have developmental potential at that time, and that, we should say, was a true continuation of the basic content of the Star Wars Program.	8	23	58	report	statementCCTVNEWS_EVENINGNEWS_CMN_20080330_225702	0	1241.963	1257.472	speaker#7	male	native	At the beginning of 2001, American President Bush Junior took office and sped up the pace of developing and deploying a missile defense system, including repeated success of missile interception testing in the missile zone. It can already be deployed in actual combat. Star Wars has continued in another form.	8	24	59	report	statement
