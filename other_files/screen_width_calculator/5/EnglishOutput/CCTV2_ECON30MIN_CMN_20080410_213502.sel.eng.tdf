This pressure is greater than that of declining sales profits.	20	25	51	report	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080410_213502	0	857.199	871.23	Liu_Jie	male	native	Some European clients have said to me unequivocally, uh, when they quote prices, they quote prices from, for example, Vietnamese, or Bengalese clients together, and then compare the price superiority.	21	26	52	filler	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080410_213502	0	871.23	886.668	speaker#6	male	native	Liu Jie told this reporter that the only measure they can employ in response is, on the one hand, positively adjusting some product mixes with the client to make up the losses brought about by the exchange rate through producing relatively profitable high-end products; and on the other hand, expanding sales in the domestic market.	22	27	53	report	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080410_213502	0	886.668	896.292	Liu_Jie	male	native	If we can do some medium and high grade level products, that being products of slightly higher added value, this in fact, uh, can offset a part of the exchange rate losses.	23	28	54	filler	statementCCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080410_213502	0	896.292	908.886	speaker#1	male	native	In the rise and fall of exchange rates, the textile industry isn't the only one influenced.
