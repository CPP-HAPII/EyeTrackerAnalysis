CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	273.068	288.756	speaker#2	male	native	As the "mother river" of the people of the northeast, it was once clear and undulating, moistening the length and breadth of the land and conveying a steady stream of water for use in production and in the home to the common people along its banks. However, in recent years, some petroleum, chemical, coal, paper-manufacturing and other enterprises have caused a certain degree of pollution to the Songhua River.	1	2	8	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	298.741	312.65	speaker#2	male	native	After this incident happened, by 2006 the work of compiling the Songhua River Water Pollution Prevention and Control 11th Five-Year Plan Program directed by the State Environment Protection Administration was already basically complete, and the Songhua River, just like the three rivers and the three lakes, would be listed as a major focus for river basin water pollution treatment.	1	2	10	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	312.65	326.29	Ma_Hong_Tao	male	native	In 2006 the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Prevention and Control Plan compiled under the direction of the State Environmental Protection Administration was ratified by the state first among the seven largest rivers nationwide.

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	362.4	371.54	Ge_Feng_Ling	male	native	Whether we can keep watch, keep watch over this last, the last post for the Songhua River is also a test for our Jiamusi city government in terms of its governing capability.	1	6	16	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	371.54	386.955	speaker#2	male	native	The Songhua River is an international river, and the urban area of Jiamusi is just 300-plus kilometers via the water route from the Sino-Russian border. Within the city itself dealing with the water quality situation seems a specially prominent problem, and bringing the water pollution of the Songhua River under control has become Ge Fengling's most important job over these past two years.	1	7	17	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	405.161	421.808	Ge_Feng_Ling	male	native	Situated in this border, a border city, our economic development is not advanced, and, relatively speaking, is rather backward. The total output of our economy is very small, and the total ((pw)) economy, GDP, of the city as a whole is just 30-odd billion.	1	10	20	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	421.808	430.292	speaker#2	male	native	On the one hand, there is our retarded economic development; on the other hand, we also need to deal with the environment, so the difficulties confronting Ge Fengling can well be imagined.	1	11	21	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	660.711	672.368	speaker#2	male	native	Many of Jiamusi's enterprises with backward production capacity in several high energy-consumption, high-polluting industries including thermal power, paper manufacturing, cement and electrolytic aluminum have been closed down in succession, among which the most significant have been paper-manufacturing enterprises.	3	15	28	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	672.368	682.375	Ge_Feng_Ling	male	native	This volume, uh, of, er, pollution and emissions reduction of all of our paper-manufacturing enterprises, accounts for a, er, 78% of the industrial wastewater discharge volume of the city as a whole.	3	16	29	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	682.375	688.956	Ge_Feng_Ling	male	native	These paper mills, ah, originally had no wastewater treatment facilities. Basically the situation was that they directly discharged it.	3	16	30	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	688.956	698.549	speaker#2	male	native	Reporters saw in a paper mill in Jiamusi's Tangyuan county that this old enterprise had just resumed trial production, and what was different from before was that soda-recycling equipment had been installed here.	3	17	31	report	statement

Formerly this wastewater with a PH value of 12 had been discharged directly into the Songhua River, and now after treatment the situation has been greatly improved.	3	21	35	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	732.885	743.069	speaker#4	female	native	Our water (()) emissions are now basically being kept in this neutral range, roughly within this range of 6.5 to 8. They should be no lower than 7.	3	22	36	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	743.069	756.537	speaker#2	male	native	As a matter of fact, the output of this enterprise that was built in the 70s of the last century is just 500,000 metric tons. The equipment is backward and the scale is limited, but after it was required to close down for reorganization and reform in 2007, it had rather a large impact on the whole area.	3	23	37	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	756.537	768.318	Ge_Feng_Ling	male	native	One-third of its fiscal revenues came from this enterprise, and this enterprise, uh, is of 1,000 people in scale, and for a county, such an enterprise was very important for the county.	3	24	38	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	768.318	775.506	speaker#2	male	native	In order to revive this old paper mill lacking in capital to begin with, the local government had to think of all possible means to raise capital.	3	25	39	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	795.163	806.256	speaker#2	male	native	After treatment was conducted, 16 paper-manufacturing enterprises in Jiamusi can now meet the zero wastewater emissions standard. This has also brought about =fundamental changes to Jiamusi's industrial wastewater emissions.	3	27	42	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	806.256	821.639	Ge_Feng_Ling	male	native	That's right. Seventy-eight per cent of the industry was (()) by the paper-manufacturing industry. Er, if its problem was solved, it would mean we have completed 78% of the task regarding the emission and treatment of industrial water pollution.	3	28	43	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	821.639	831.932	Ma_Hong_Tao	male	native	Apart from the paper-manufacturing industry, Jiamusi had also made major interventions in such key industries as equipment manufacturing, chemical engineering, coal and building materials, to reduce polluting emissions and raise the level of comprehensive use of natural resources.	3	29	44	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	831.932	837.499	Ma_Hong_Tao	male	native	There is this saying that everyone knows, that there is no such thing as rubbish in this world, just natural resources that have been misplaced.	3	29	45	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	854.461	868.133	speaker#2	male	native	It's the beginning of March already, and reporters in Wanqing village on the outskirts of Jiamusi city saw that the villagers here were all discussing the varieties of rice they would plant this year. This would also directly affect their final annual income.	3	30	47	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	906.759	914.539	speaker#2	male	native	And, apart from the fact that prices were higher than the market purchasing price rates, after signing the contracts it also solved the villagers' problems in selling grain.	3	34	51	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	941.805	949.137	Li_Tao	male	native	Because after our paddy comes in, uh, it needs to be transported out after being processing into rice. We can only earn money by forming a cycle.	3	37	54	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	959.95	967.309	Li_Tao	male	native	When the paddy passes here, uh, it is stripped, and the husk, uh, is peeled off, and the rice bran's second layer of rice bran on the outside is also peeled off.	3	39	56	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	967.309	973.907	Li_Tao	male	native	So the rice husk, uh, goes along this conveyor pipe, and after it has come over, it is directly blown into the power plant for combustion.	3	39	57	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	973.907	981.032	speaker#2	male	native	This is the first power plant using rice husks to generate electricity nationwide. It is hard to imagine that the tiny rice husks can actually have such a large effect.	3	40	58	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	981.032	991.667	Li_Tao	male	native	So, um, this ratio of this calorific value from burning rice husks, uh, to that from coal, uh, is approximately that 1.5 or 1.75 metric tons of rice husks are equivalent to one metric ton of standard coal.	3	41	59	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1002.235	1019.177	speaker#2	male	native	Li Tao told the reporters that these rice husks were formerly seen as rubbish and were discarded everywhere, requiring five years' time to disintegrate, causing great environmental pollution, and now using rice husks to generate electricity can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 96 metric tons a year, and can reduce emissions of smoke and dust by =65.6 metric tons.	3	42	61	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1019.177	1024.302	speaker#2	male	native	At the same time, the rice bran that previously could not be used has nowadays become a valuable thing here for Li Tao.	3	42	62	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1047.938	1061.093	speaker#2	male	native	Li Tao calculated for the reporters that after using the paddy that previously could only be used as a simple foodstuff in recycling, the cost of each metric ton of paddy could be reduced by close to 120 yuan, and this is why he can purchase it at a price higher than the market price.	5	44	67	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1061.093	1073.89	Li_Tao	male	native	So you can say, after a paddy plant comes in, the husk can be used in combustion, the rice bran can go for oil-pressing, and the rice can be used to make finished products for use. The whole of a paddy plant is comprehensively used.	5	45	68	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1073.89	1094.129	speaker#2	male	native	Li Tao said that he will now "eat and press" his paddy with no leftovers, allowing the paddy to increase in value on the spot where it is produced. This way the peasants' difficulty in selling rice will be solved; on the other hand, a good recycling economy is achieved by such an industrial integration, reducing the waste of natural resources and the pollution to the environment caused by the wasteful disposal of byproducts of rice factories.	5	46	69	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1094.129	1108.023	Li_Tao	male	native	As far as the significance of this, the whole of this processing, is concerned, uh, after they have been comprehensively used up, they can be -- these plants provided to us by nature can be completely used, uh, and not, not cause any pollution to the environment.	5	47	70	report	
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1264.879	1276.133	Ma_Hong_Tao	male	native	In Jiamusi we have also seen a green industry, whose value to the environment protection, economic value is even greater than the use of paddy in recycling, which has opened up an even wider treasure-house of natural resources for Jiamusi. Let's go and take another look.	7	49	73	report	statement

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1390.971	1397.675	speaker#2	male	native	Due to the unique wind-power resources here, many people in the industry have begun itching to carry out investment in wind power here.	9	59	84	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1397.675	1415.11	Zheng_Yan_Tao	male	native	The reserves of wind-power resources, er, in the Jiamusi area are very plentiful. Uh, it has the potential of large-scale development, therefore, various large companies, especially our, er, energy and power companies, er, are keenly optimistic about this wind-power resource in Jiamusi, and are more than willing to invest.	9	60	85	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1415.11	1424.236	speaker#2	male	native	The gradual increase in wind-driven power generation means a gradual decrease in thermal power generation, and the Jiamusi city government has long made plans for the use of this clean energy.	9	61	86	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1424.236	1438.064	speaker#9	male	native	We in the municipal party committee and the city government have set a long-term objective to develop our Jiamusi into a 1,000-megawatt wind-power city of this kind (()) within three to five years.	9	62	87	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1456.827	1464.0	Ge_Feng_Ling	male	native	That means that whichever enterprise comes and damages our local natural resources will actually have harmed our ordinary people, which is firmly forbidden.	9	64	89	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1464.0	1486.858	speaker#2	male	native	In Ge Fengling's view, in Jiamusi, projects that waste natural resources are firmly forbidden, projects that destroy the ecological environment are firmly forbidden, and projects that do not comply with national industrial policies are firmly forbidden, and it is precisely due to his persistence that prevention and control of the pollution of the Songhua River in Jiamusi have achieved notable results. While the water quality of incoming water from the upper reaches hasn't changed much, the water quality of the lower reaches in Jiamusi has seen significant changes.	9	65	90	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1486.858	1499.305	Ge_Feng_Ling	male	native	Before the Songhua River water pollution incident, the water quality of the Songhua River, right, in our Jiamusi section was always, uh, about that of Grade IV water, that is, Grade IV water.	9	66	91	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1499.305	1515.107	Ge_Feng_Ling	male	native	So the same river's water leaving our borders was also Grade IV water, and so by our treating it over these past two years, in the second half of the year 2007 its water quality basically stabilized above that of Grade III water.	9	66	92	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1515.107	1520.123	speaker#2	male	native	And as the force behind these changes, Jiamusi city also expended huge costs.	9	67	93	report	statement

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1587.055	1596.101	Ma_Hong_Tao	male	native	But, uh, what distresses people is that the media have recently exposed a series of companies that are continuing to launch polluting projects, and the governments of some localities have also adopted an attitude of connivance towards these projects.	9	71	101	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080413_213502	0	1596.101	1609.832	Ma_Hong_Tao	male	native	This cannot fail to make us question, even though the slogan of saving energy and reducing emissions has begun to be shouted in many localities nationwide, with slogans sprayed on walls and banners hung in the air, exactly how many cities can practically implement energy savings and emissions reduction like Jiamusi.	9	71	102	report	statement
