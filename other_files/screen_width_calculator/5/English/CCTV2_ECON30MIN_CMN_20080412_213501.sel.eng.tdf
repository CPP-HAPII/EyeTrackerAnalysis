CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	241.633	249.273	speaker#1	male	native	However, the road beneath their feet is not flat. The three highway disorders of setting up checkpoints, imposing fines and charging tolls without authorization have brought quite a lot of drivers sufferings beyond words.	1	1	3	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	249.273	258.554	speaker#1	male	native	Today let's get to know one of these drivers. He has also frequently experienced the three highway disorders, but has not kept silent like other drivers.	1	1	4	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	310.601	315.507	speaker#2	male	native	Wang Jinwu told the other side issues to note as specifically as possible.	5	6	12	report	statement

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	333.644	338.456	speaker#2	male	native	In October 2004, he bought a truck with a friend and started a transportation business.	7	8	15	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	338.456	349.418	speaker#2	male	native	It was since then that Wang Jinwu found the biggest headache during transportation was actually paying various kinds of fines from organizations such as the traffic police, traffic check and load control posts.	7	8	16	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	366.356	377.754	speaker#2	male	native	Growing fines left Wang Jinwu wonder that some traffic enforcement officers only impose fines without unloading or correcting violations, and drivers can go away so long as they have paid fines.	9	10	18	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	377.754	394.637	speaker#2	male	native	Yet they are fined one more time whenever they go through a county. For the same matter, fines by the traffic police are not recognized by the traffic control, and fines by the traffic control are not recognized by the traffic police either. As a result, the phenomenon that truck drivers get accustomed to such weird things seems to have been a hidden rule, which drivers seldom challenge.	9	10	19	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	394.637	397.372	speaker#2	male	native	Nevertheless Wang Jinwu became serious.	9	10	20	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	397.372	414.31	speaker#2	male	native	He, who quit school in the first year of high school, bought relevant supportive books on law and regulations, such as the Highway Law, the Road Traffic Safety Law and the Administrative Review Law, after which whenever he was fined, he would cite legal provisions for comparison to see if the fine had any legal basis and if it was irregular.	9	10	21	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	414.31	431.075	speaker#2	male	native	In March 2005, in Yichuan County, Henan, Wang Jinwu's truck was penalized twice for the same reason in a single day by the traffic police authority, one incurred a fine of 300 yuan, the other 400 yuan. Wang Jinwu applied for administrative review to the Yichuan County Public Security Bureau on ground of irregular procedures.	9	10	22	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	460.897	471.147	speaker#2	male	native	Wang Jinwu succeeded in his first little trial. After that every time he was fined, Wang Jinwu would cite legal provisions for comparison and would complain and defend his rights if he was not convinced.	11	12	24	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	481.71	485.97	speaker#2	male	native	That's how Wang Jinwu came to lock horns with the three highway disorders.	11	12	26	report	statement

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	523.233	538.499	speaker#2	male	native	Before passing a toll station, truck drivers will simply prepare half the amount of the fine in the driver license beforehand, and after checking the driver license, the staff member will put the money in his or her own pocket without asking any questions, let alone issuing any fine receipts.	13	17	34	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	538.499	546.655	speaker#2	male	native	Judging from the processes, which need no words or interactions at all, the two parties have apparently got used to such practices.	13	17	35	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	546.655	555.311	speaker#2	male	native	This is Chafang limit control checkpoint in the city of Shangzhou. The driver keeps asking questions about the fine, but only met a deaf ear of the traffic policeman.	13	17	36	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	562.24	570.115	speaker#2	male	native	When the truck driver hesitates on the penalty receipt, the traffic policeman even signs for the driver by himself.	15	19	38	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	591.646	595.943	speaker#2	male	native	The whole picture conveys only one message, which is paying money.	17	25	45	report	statement

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	799.741	814.96	speaker#1	male	native	Since the latter half of 2005, Wang Jinwu's act has been spread by word of mouth amongst truck drivers in different places. People think he has taken a good lead, and there are those keep coming for advice or simply entrust Wang Jinwu with the full power to file lawsuits.	22	36	61	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	814.96	823.022	speaker#1	male	native	Trust from peers has made Wang Jinwu proud, but since setting foot on the road to defend rights, Wang Jinwu has also tasted all sorts of joys and sorrows.	22	36	62	report	statement

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	841.258	842.164	speaker#7	female	native	Oh, I've got all of them.	23	39	67	filler	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	861.01	869.166	speaker#2	male	native	Wang Jinwu has accepted nearly 500 rights-defending cases over the past three years. Initially his success rate in rights advocacy was as high as 80 percent.	24	43	71	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	869.166	876.838	speaker#2	male	native	Now Wang Jinwu is his third year on the road of rights advocacy, but gradually he begins to feel his ability is falling short of his ambition.	24	43	72	report	statement

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1051.327	1056.874	speaker#2	male	native	Wang Jinwu is very irritated. Seeing the office clerk leave, he decides to petition.	30	54	93	report	statement

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1072.672	1077.703	speaker#2	male	native	Wang Jinwu rushes back to Xishan overnight. By the time he is home, it's already 4.00am the next morning.	30	54	96	report	statement

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1149.351	1158.899	speaker#2	male	native	What's more irritating to Wang Jinwu is that rulings on some cases are not only left unimplemented, but relevant local authorities would take retaliating measures to penalize the person involved.	34	61	107	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1158.899	1174.383	speaker#2	male	native	In this court ruling, the reporter saw three Xishan drivers in 2006 refused to accept fines imposed by Luoning Transportation Control Office on ground of unauthorized driver vehicle refit.

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1174.383	1189.883	speaker#2	male	native	However, not only did Luoning Transportation Control Office fail to refund the fine, but it reissued a notice to impose another penalty on the three drivers for the same reason.

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1211.988	1222.581	speaker#2	male	native	In fact, many truck drivers have no time or habit to surf the Internet, but Wang Jinwu thinks however small the force is, there must be someone to do or push it for it to slowly have effect.	36	63	113	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1389.942	1391.27	speaker#1	male	native	Welcome back to our program.	38	65	115	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1391.27	1405.864	speaker#1	male	native	Just now we saw Wang Jinwu is already in his third year on the road of rights advocacy. With more and more driver friends approaching him, he has also come to realize that it will only consume more energy and time if he files each one case of administrative review and complaint single-handedly.	38	65	116	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1405.864	1426.352	speaker#1	male	native	In 2007, Wang Jinwu ever wrote a jointly signed letter to the National People's Congress together with 470 truck owners in Xixia, noting three major problems, namely inconsistencies in traffic administration laws and regulations, failure of traffic authorities that charge road tolls to provide basic traffic conditions, and lack of legal ground of the Road Transportation Regulation, are the sources of the three highway disorders.	38	65	117	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1426.352	1430.414	speaker#1	male	native	So faced with the three highway disorders, do drivers have better solutions?	38	65	118	report	question

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1473.334	1484.584	speaker#2	male	native	Because of the high mobility in their work, the time and economic costs for truck drivers to defend their rights are higher than people in other trades, so many drivers easily give up rights advocacy and choose to pay for convenience.	40	68	123	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1484.584	1488.506	speaker#2	male	native	Bao Jie, a lawyer specialized in traffic cases for a long time, gave such advice.	40	68	124	report	statement

CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1530.34	1544.714	speaker#2	male	native	However, using the channel of legal remedies afterwards targets specific cases after all. There are over 10 million truck drivers nationwide. As for how to fundamentally address torts inflicted by the three highway disorders, we need to tackle the problems at the source.	42	70	130	report	statement
CCTV2_ECON30MIN_CMN_20080412_213501	0	1544.714	1552.714	speaker#2	male	native	Xia Pengju, executive chief of the newspaper Modern Drivers, who has long been exposed to relevant complaints, told the reporter the systematic reason is where the problem lies.	42	70	131	report	statement
