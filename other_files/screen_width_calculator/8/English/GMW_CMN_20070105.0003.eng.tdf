GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	60010.000	60019.900				The national film box office for 2006 is estimated to be around 2.6 billion yuan, a marked increase compared with last year's box office revenues of 2 billion yuan.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	70010.000	70019.900				On the one hand, this is attributed to the increase in the number of film productions, and on the other hand, it is because the 300 screens newly added throughout the country this year are all spread out among the 60 new modern multiplexes that are built this year. These 300 screens are quality-guaranteed active screens with high attendance rates.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	80010.000	80019.900				Companies in the advertising industry are increasingly appreciating the special features of films as a media platform, and are pumping in more money year after year.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	80020.000	80029.900				Correspondingly, many domestic productions have taken a big step forward in market integration and promotion this year. All sorts of embedded advertisements, television media advertisements, and outdoor advertisements appeared especially for a few mega productions such as Fearless, Confession of Pain, The Banquet, and The City of Golden Armor.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	90010.000	90019.900				In addition, the distribution channels of films in the country are gradually diversifying.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	90020.000	90029.900				The development of new media such as the Internet is especially starting to have a direct impact on the film industry. Domestic distributors have all begun to get involved in the Internet and IPTV channel distribution this year. Films that are "associated with the Internet" range from mega productions like Dragon Tiger Gate and The Banquet to various kinds of small-budget productions like Crazy Stone and Luxury Car.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	100010.000	100019.900				This year, with some mega commercial films such as The Banquet, Dragon Tiger Gate, and The City of Golden Armor selling like hot cakes at various major film festivals and various major film trading markets overseas, China's domestic film companies, including Hong Kong companies, are starting to build up influence abroad. Many international buyers have even begun making follow-up trips to Beijing and Hong Kong to buy films.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	100020.000	100029.900				The significant rise in overseas revenues of Chinese films has become a major phenomenon.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	110010.000	110019.900				As the film industry has gradually gained the attention and support of the advertising industry, telecommunications industry, and new media in China, revenues from film copyrights are also diversified. Furthermore, with the gradual improvement and perfection of various regulations in the legal and financial systems as well as the insurance industry, film investors have more guarantees on capital returns and profits.	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	130010.000	130019.900				However, while Chinese films are "growing rapidly" by various statistics, they also face numerous dilemmas and embarrassment.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	130020.000	130029.900				For instance, behind the 50% increase in the number of domestic productions this year in comparison with last year, what is the increase ratio of films that were really put into the market and given a certain scale of market distribution?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	130030.000	130039.900				Have ordinary viewers honestly felt such increase?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	140010.000	140019.900				Following this thought, there are still many issues that require serious consideration: The number of screens is increasing continuously, but how did this year's average ticket price nationwide change as compared with the same period last year?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	140020.000	140029.900				With a steep progressive increase in investment amount, what are the input-output effects of the industry?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	140030.000	140039.900				This year, due to various reasons such as piracy, the market for original DVDs has almost slid to its bottom in the last few years. Although Internet broadband, IPTV, and the like have risen to the occasion, they still come under restrictions from various sides, being able to only share the fringe benefits from films...	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	150010.000	150019.900				The above issues demand that we no longer only seek an increase in the number of film productions, but should also boost the domestic market returns for mega commercial films and some ((pw)) and medium-cost films.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	150020.000	150029.900				For instance, while box office is skyrocketing, is it possible to reduce the distribution cost?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	150030.000	150039.900				It is a waste of resources when operating cost is too high.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	150040.000	150049.900				In addition, the copyright revenues from television stations should be further increased. Currently film channels are exclusive operators. Avenues should be opened to allow more television stations to participate in buying films.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	150050.000	150059.900				At present, the illegal broadcast of films by television stations every year brings rather huge losses to the film industry. While combating piracy and illegal film broadcasting, the State should guide them so that they can purchase films through a reasonable film sales channel.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	160010.000	160019.900				The domestic film industry is in urgent need for standardization. For instance, all government departments and people from all industries need to give support in areas of perfecting laws, giving preferential tax treatment, and enhancing banking and financial service systems, including controlling the film industry environment, combating piracy committed through Internet downloads, combating DVD piracy, combating illegal broadcast of films by television stations, protecting the investment and operation environments of the film industry.	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	180010.000	180019.900				The diversified needs of the film market determine that domestic filmmakers cannot only produce mega commercial films with high investment, but should also offer the audience commercial films of more different genres and scales, as well as other types of productions.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	180020.000	180029.900				As such, compared against mega commercial productions like The Banquet and The City of Golden Armor, Crazy Stone, a low-cost dark comedy this summer, sets a very good example for the future market for small-budget domestic productions. The inspiration it gives to the industry insiders especially deserves attention.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	190010.000	190019.900				Crazy Stone, a film entirely about mainland China, was produced by mainland director and actors in mainland China. Two-thirds of the cost was funded by ATV Hong Kong, and it was packaged with the "FOCUS: First Cuts" concept. Through selling a certain period of copyright for use in mainland China, the other one-third of the investment comes from a mainland company. The ultimate copyright of the film, however, remains in Hong Kong. This is a successful joint investment model between Hong Kong and the mainland, and such model that uses the joint production method to expand the overseas market is exactly the first step of the "three-step" strategy that is worth learning by domestic filmmakers.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	190020.000	190029.900				Right now, due to limited space in the mainland market, the country can only take on a part of the total film investment for ordinary domestic productions; the remaining capital should come from other markets within the Mandarin-speaking regions.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	190030.000	190039.900				A more feasible way is to produce some low-cost films by cooperating with Hong Kong and Taiwanese markets through pre-sales.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	200010.000	200019.900				The second step is to gradually develop overseas buyers of Chinese films.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	200020.000	200029.900				Allow buyers who buy Chinese films to first make profits, thereby forming a long-term strategic cooperation relationship.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	200030.000	200039.900				Chinese films should be introduced abroad in a collective and large-scale manner, and film buyers there must be developed.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	210010.000	210019.900				If a region spends 200,000 to 300,000 US dollars to buy a domestic production, this would be a huge support.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	220010.000	220019.900				The third step is to rely on the future potential of our robust mainland Chinese market.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	220020.000	220029.900				If there is 20 billion in box office every year in future, there will be no need for joint production, and producing films about mainland China is entirely workable. When that time comes, even young directors can appear in the market through various forms of films.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070105.0003	0	230010.000	230019.900				In our opinion, the prospects for Chinese films in 2007 will be thriving and encouraging, but on the other hand we should recognize clearly the irrationality of the tendency of the "extensive" growth model in the Chinese film industry. Mentality cannot determine everything, but at least it can influence the perspective in which one considers problems. To have a more in-depth understanding of the current development of the Chinese film market and to look into the next years and future, an appropriate mentality is very much needed. This is especially so around the end of the year when people are busy with making hasty summaries.	0	0	0
