GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	10010.000	10019.900				More "Citizens' Voices" Lead to Less 'Secretary's Complaint'	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	20010.000	20019.900				Deng Haijian (teacher of Jiangsu), January 31, 2007	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	30010.000	30019.900				Secretary of Shenzhen Municipal Party Committee Li Hongzhong called the Bureau of Communications of Shenzhen Municipality to complain the uncleanness of individual buses and demanded the communications department to take effective measures in finding solutions to the problem.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	30020.000	30029.900				As a result, Shenzhen launched the 'Public Transportation Cleanliness Overhaul' Initiative again.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	30030.000	30039.900				Yesterday, the Municipal Bureau of Communications held an emergency meeting to plan the Public Transportation Cleanliness Overhaul Initiative and requested "to clean every bus".	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	30040.000	30049.900				(January 25, Nanfang Daily)	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	40010.000	40019.900				We should say that this is a favorable news in urban people's livelihood.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	40020.000	40029.900				Secretary of Municipal Party Committee concerned about public transportation and urged the municipal public transportation department to actually clean the 'snow at its doorstep'.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	40030.000	40039.900				In this sense, we should give the Secretary who showed concern for details of people's livelihood a round of applause.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	40040.000	40049.900				Actually, the appeal to have each bus cleaned cannot be considered a complicated proposition. Many residents who pack into the filthy buses everyday have long harbored resentment and grievances. I imagine there are also many complaints. If that does not work, drivers and conductors naturally have seen or heard many complaints about 'filthy buses' by residents.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	40050.000	40059.900				Why did the voice of cleaning every bus made by the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee alone can awaken the muddle-headed?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	50010.000	50019.900				It is of course, right for the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee to concern about the cleanliness of buses. However, no self-defined administrative power that comes from top down can produce any predictable results.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	50020.000	50029.900				The untold worry of the residents is: In this era of diversified interests and revival of rights, whether the value orientation of public interest or public decision making 'turns left' or 'goes right' always depends on which interest group have more voices. Will urban decisions orient more toward democracy and fairness without full expressions of citizens' words but rely on the self-defined decision-making inertia by the government alone?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	60010.000	60019.900				There are a few antilogies in the issue of 'cleanliness of public transportation' that require our reflection: First, they were both voices of the citizens. Why did many factual complaints of bus passengers worth less than the complaint of a citizen with the status of a Secretary of the Party Committee?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	60020.000	60029.900				Why couldn't the public transportation department that has huge public opinion channel take the initiative to give public opinion a systemic outlet in the matter of listening to citizens' voices?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	60030.000	60039.900				Or you can say, if not for the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee 'poking his nose into other people's business', would they clean the urban buses spontaneously?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	70010.000	70019.900				In addition, public transportation is an industry that involves public good. It is also a monopolized industry. The savageness and arrogance of some urban public transportation has also become an 'epidemic' under the monopoly system. Then, is there any effectively monitored system that follows up to help citizens express and achieve powerful effects?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	70020.000	70029.900				Originally, if we only look at it from the logic of Economics, complaints of many passengers should worth more than the complaint of a Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	80010.000	80019.900				A Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee has more macro decision-making view that requires his attention in the first place. The best answer for "the cleanliness level of a bus' should be sought and responded by residents.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	80020.000	80029.900				More importantly, every city has many more details of people's livelihood that deserve attention. A Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee alone 'is willing yet unable' to take care of all these: For example, the scarcity and lack of trashcans along main roads; for example, the 'non-hindrance' facilities and 'unisex' public restrooms provided for the handicapped; for example, the sharp edges and corners on the handrails of buses; for example, trash suddenly thrown from above, for example, having abundant and precise public signs that are people-oriented... the vast public are the only ones who always live among them.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	90010.000	90019.900				In a sense, citizens' voices and secretary's complaint are probably two polarities of a seesaw: more citizens' voices will lead to less secretary's complaint.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070131.0003	0	90020.000	90029.900				'Good administration' of a city is essentially a kind of public administration that requires to give citizens' voices more opportunities and greater power.	0	0	0
