PLA_CMN_20070111.0229	0	20010.000	20019.900				Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 11 (Reporter Wang Jintao). The Chengdu Railways Bureau released information on the 11th that the comprehensive testing on our nation's first ballastless railway track was completed on the night of the 10th.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070111.0229	0	20020.000	20029.900				The testing result showed a trial speed of the freight train reaching 232 kilometers per hour. Its smoothness and comfortable level had achieved excellent level. All testing data were within safety standard.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070111.0229	0	30010.000	30019.900				In September 2004, the Ministry of Railways decided to build our nation's first ballastless track trial section at the Sui Yu Railway. The regular line is 13.16 kilometers long.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070111.0229	0	30020.000	30029.900				Under the leadership and direction of the Ministry of Railways, the trial section task team persisted in independent innovation and integrated usage, production, study, and research to finish building the first ballastless track trial section of which our nation has the independent intellectual property rights after almost 28 months of arduous struggle.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070111.0229	0	30030.000	30039.900				The comprehensive testing on the Sui Yu Railway ballastless track trial section began on January 3, 2007.	0	0	0

PLA_CMN_20070111.0229	0	40020.000	40029.900				All regular railways lay sleepers or cement and steel tracks with ballast as the foundation. However, this type of railway is not suitable for trains to travel high speed.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070111.0229	0	40030.000	40039.900				According to information, the Sui Yu trial section broke the limit of laying ballastless track on big overpass for the first time, laid ballastless track switch for the first time, grasped the syntonic rail circuit transmission technology used by ballastless track for the first time, and built a section of ballastless track railway for the first time.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070111.0229	0	40040.000	40049.900				Results of the comprehensive testing showed: All indices met safety standard when the freight train passed the switch. The roadbed structure of ballastless track could fulfill the requirements of smoothness and comfortable level of the running of high-speed trains. The bridge structure of ballastless track could meet the operational safety requirement of passenger train traveling 200 kilometers and above. The design and building of our nation's first ballastless track had reached world's advanced standard.	0	0	0
