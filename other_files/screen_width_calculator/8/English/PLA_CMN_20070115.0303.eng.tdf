PLA_CMN_20070115.0303	0	60020.000	60029.900				Sun Shengwei argued that in order to minimize the disadvantages brought about by the narrow talent selection range, it requires the heightening of training quality by scientific training, the effective prolonging of sports life of veteran athletes, and the acceleration of the speed for young potential athletes to become valuable.	0	0	0
