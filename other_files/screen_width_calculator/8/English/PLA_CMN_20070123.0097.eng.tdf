PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	30010.000	30019.900				Xinhua News Agency, Beijing on January 23, Sports Special (Reporter Shen Nan) Although the Chinese Shooting team fought a good battle in the end of last year's "mid-term test," the Doha Asian Games, however, on the road to the "big test" Beijing Olympic Games, the Chinese shooting team may be said to face "four" crises, especially when the established veteran Russian team is running to world shooting like a ferocious tiger descending a mountain.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	40010.000	40019.900				During the national shooting and archery training conference on the 23rd, National Sports Bureau Shooting and Archery Sport Administrative Center director Gao Zhidan pointed out that, for the shooting event to attain good results in the Beijing Olympic Games, it has to face concrete difficulties from four areas.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	50010.000	50019.900				First, the Beijing Olympic Games have reduced the number of events from last Olympics' 17 to 15, eliminating the two events of men's moving target and women's skeet shooting, in which the Chinese team has major dominance.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	50020.000	50029.900				Beijing athlete Yang Ling has been a two-time men's moving target Olympic champion, whereas China's women's bi-direction to multi-direction players also repeatedly reached for gold and silver in major international game competitions.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	60010.000	60019.900				Second, the rules of some events have changed, increasing the randomness of the competition.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	60020.000	60029.900				Starting from 2005, the men's rapid fire pistol, the women's sport pistol, and the multi-direction and bi-direction skeet events have started to use new equipment or competition rules, in which four key Chinese team's Olympic dominances are involved.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	60030.000	60039.900				Besides the women's sport pistol, an important goal of rule changes in the remaining events is to increase the difficulty and randomness of the competition.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	60040.000	60049.900				At present, because the Chinese men's rapid fire pistol had an early start, it once had certain superiority, but after other competitors slowly adapted, the dominance has already nearly vanished. Whereas the skeet event is not yet completely adapted, in multi-direction single shot and bi-direction and multi-direction difficult target events, there is still a lack of mastery.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	70010.000	70019.900				Third, from an internal perspective, with the record-setting four gold medals in the Athens Olympic Games, along with the Doha Asian Games major successes, the expectation of Shooting has been raised further. Although the Beijing Olympic Games have the hosting advantages in location, equipment, safeguard, etc., there will also be more psychological and mental pressures than before.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	70020.000	70029.900				The hosting countries' performances in the shooting events during the past several Olympic Games have already sounded the alarm for the Chinese team.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	80010.000	80019.900				Fourth, from an external perspective, the Russian team is still maintaining the lead in overall strength, while the Chinese team lags behind Russia in quantity and quality of talented players, especially in the scope of event dominance, etc.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	80020.000	80029.900				What we need to bring to special attention is that starting from this year, the Russian shooting performance has been boosted quickly by their system and their concentrated training safeguard, and it has a strong development trend.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	80030.000	80039.900				In last year's international championship, they obtained 5 Olympic gold medals, same as the Chinese team, while the total number of medals was 3 less than the Chinese team's 12. But after two months in the World Cup finals, in one swoop they reaped in 9 gold medals out of the 15, whereas the Chinese team only obtained one.	0	0	0

PLA_CMN_20070123.0097	0	90010.000	90019.900				"These difficulties require us to maintain a sober mind when satisfactory situations appear. We must see the shadows under our gold medal's halo. We should even want to make self-exposure and ponder over ourselves, only then can we have the possibility of a good Beijing Olympic Games," Gao Zhidan said.	0	0	0
