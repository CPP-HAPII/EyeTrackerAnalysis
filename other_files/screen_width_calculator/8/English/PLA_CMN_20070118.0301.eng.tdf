PLA_CMN_20070118.0301	0	40030.000	40039.900				Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court Vice-President Huang Rongfu said after the public hearing that it can make sentence commutation and parole public and transparent, and is advantageous in further guaranteeing the judge's fairness and dispelling public misgivings.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070118.0301	0	50010.000	50019.900				Huang Rongfu said that, for a long time, because the "Law of Criminal Procedure" had no explicit stipulations, plus the quantity of sentence commutation and parole cases was great and the legal trial periods were comparatively short for a long time; therefore, the court has usually adopted a method of trial by writing. This would easily cause people involved in the case and the general public to have doubts. For instance, some prisoners serving sentences, who didn't obtain the sentence commutation and parole, might suspect that there were "deals" involved in the trial process.	0	0	0
