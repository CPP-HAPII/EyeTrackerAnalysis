PDA_CMN_20070131.0302	0	30010.000	30019.900				Chinataiwan.org, January 31 news - According to Taiwan media reports, in order to emphasize the importance of "legalizing" Taiwan's "Central Election Commission," the Kuomintang will prearrange on the 31st (today) for the print media to publish advertisements across the island appealing for the necessity of examining and passing the "Constitutive Draft Law Concerning the Central Election Commission."	0	0	0		
PDA_CMN_20070131.0302	0	40010.000	40019.900				During the last day of the Taiwan "Legislative Yuan" session on January 19, Democratic Progressive Party representatives inside the "Legislative Yuan" boycotted the session completely to prevent the examination of the "Constitutive Draft Law Concerning the Central Election Commission," causing the Taiwan authority's 2007 "general budget bill" not to be able to be examined and passed smoothly as well. Taiwan's "Legislative Yuan" on the 29th held a meeting. The Democratic Progressive Party persisted in putting the "general budget bill" as a first priority as before, causing the conceived additional interim session to delay. The Democratic Progressive Party shirked the responsibility to the Kuomintang, and the Kuomintang counter-attacked.	0	0	0

PDA_CMN_20070131.0302	0	50020.000	50029.900				The Kuomintang believes that the current control of the "Central Election Commission" under the Democratic Progressive Party causes unfair elections to occur over and over. Even the election method and the voting procedure were all being manipulated. If the "Central Election Commission" is not constituted according to the proposal, there will be no fairness to speak of. What if in the future there again appears the situation of "the referendum tying up with the election" and "the two bullets"?	0	0	0
