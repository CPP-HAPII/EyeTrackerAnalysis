PDA_CMN_20070113.0029	0	30010.000	30019.900				Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 13 - (Reporter: Zhou Lei) "The domestication technology of spotted-deer has already matured, but spotted-deer reared at homes are still being listed as a national-class protected animal. But on the contrary, the endangered species arethusa - due to a lack of legal restraint - is still being illicitly and excessively poached." Experts believe that a serious systematic and legal lag exists in China's protection of wildlife.	0	0	0

Hence there is no legal basis whatsoever for its relevant management. Yet many arethusa are located only in parts of Yunnan Province, and are in a precariously endangered state.	0	0	0

Postela, a Dutch expert who has been engaged in wildlife protection and community participation projects in Yunnan for several years, believes that although the Chinese government has undertaken great efforts in wildlife protection, the construction of most conservation areas is actually like "an isolated island," lacking an "ecological corridor" for the exchange of gene species. Hence, in this aspect, the Chinese government should bring into better play the enthusiasm of local villagers, instead of just constructing conservation areas with administrative undertones.	0	0	0
