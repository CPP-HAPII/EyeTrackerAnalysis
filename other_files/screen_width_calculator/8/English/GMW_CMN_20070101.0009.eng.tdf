GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	30010.000	30019.900				It is another Christmas.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	30020.000	30029.900				In recent years, the Christmas atmosphere in Chinese cities is getting stronger.	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	30040.000	30049.900				However, this writer believes that if we look at the historical evolution of Chinese culture, we will know that there is no need to have so much dislike for Christmas.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	40010.000	40019.900				Taking a broad overview of the long history of China, how many foreign cultures were there that entered?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	40020.000	40029.900				What happened in the end has been basically the blending of foreign cultures with the Chinese culture (mainly referring to the Central Plains culture). +In its blending and interacting with foreign cultures, not only has the Chinese culture not lost its own spirit and connotation, it instead shows more vitality due to tolerance and acceptance.	0	0	0

In the end, however, they lived in harmony with the Central Plains culture and were even willing to learn and accept the Central Plains culture, finally becoming a part of the Chinese culture.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	60010.000	60019.900				What is most worth mentioning is the cultural ferment of India's Buddhism and Chinese culture.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	60020.000	60029.900				Buddhism was disseminated into China since the Western Han Dynasty. It mixed deeply with the Chinese culture and blended completely into the Chinese cultural system which created the Chan Sect, a pure Chinese Buddhist sect.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	60030.000	60039.900				Buddhism has a far-reaching influence on the culture and society of China, but not only did it not let the Chinese people get lost in the knowledge of the "Tatar," it instead let the Chinese culture appear more profound, brilliant, and sagacious in the process of assimilation and drawing on experience.	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	70020.000	70029.900				The Chinese culture, however, has not lost itself because of this.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	80010.000	80019.900				What is worth mentioning is that in those years, many Jesuits who came to China to preach were, instead, touched by the spirit of the Chinese culture, and introduced Chinese philosophy to Europe secretly, leading to a Chinese cultural fever in Europe 200 years before.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	90010.000	90019.900				A confident and tolerant person will discover that the more he contacts with the outside world, the broader his wisdom and vision will be.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	90020.000	90029.900				A confident nation also will definitely not be scared of foreign cultures.	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	100030.000	100039.900				A very important reason why the United States today can prosper is its spirit of cultural tolerance.	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	120010.000	120019.900				On the other hand, although Europe has a deeper cultural background compared to the United States, it seems a bit conservative and complacent.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	130010.000	130019.900				We do not need to dislike Christmas trees so much and be unhappy with the Christmas greetings that are going around everywhere these few days.	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070101.0009	0	130030.000	130039.900				Facing the strong cultures from the West, what we probably need more is to reflect: Chinese cultural background has been confident, but are we today also fully confident because we really understand our own culture?	0	0	0
