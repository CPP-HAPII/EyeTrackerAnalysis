PDA_CMN_20070110.0139	0	30010.000	30019.900				Chinanews.com January 10 - In recent years, the Taiwan army has been continuously reduced, but the number of military police has continued to be increased.	0	0	0		
PDA_CMN_20070110.0139	0	30020.000	30029.900				The total army in Taiwan does not exceed 300 thousand, yet among them there are some 17,000 military police.	0	0	0		
PDA_CMN_20070110.0139	0	30030.000	30039.900				In response, a "legislator" has suggested that this would result in the improper waste of pivotal resources, and had proposed that the "Ministry of National Defense Organization Act" be amended. He also suggested that future military police should follow the example of artillery troops and armored corps that the "Military Police Command" should be combined with the Military Police School.	0	0	0		
PDA_CMN_20070110.0139	0	40010.000	40019.900				According to a "BCC News Network" report, a "legislator" with army background, Shuai Hua-min, had pointed out that the manpower structure of any organization must follow a certain proportion, and while the total number of Taiwan's army is decreasing continuously right now, the military policy is constantly being increased.	0	0	0

But the obvious situation right now is that the emphasis is only paid on the final task: "A limited budget is provided for such a large army branch, but this has no direct bearing on warfare."	0	0	0		
PDA_CMN_20070110.0139	0	50010.000	50019.900				Hence, Shuai Hua-min has called for the revision and amendment of relevant laws so as to return the military police to their original tasks. Except for the maintenance and attachment of a certain number of military police to each combat zone, other zones should be reduced as far as possible. The "Military Policy Command" should also be merged into one with the "Military Police School."	0	0	0
