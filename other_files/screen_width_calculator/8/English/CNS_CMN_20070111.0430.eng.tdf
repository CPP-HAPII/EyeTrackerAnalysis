CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	40010.000	40019.900				Chinanews, January 11 The Chongqing Evening News reports that the transfer of Sun Xiang to Eredivisie giants Eindhoven, which seemed to be close to completion, has become much more complicated because of blocking by Shanghai Shenhua Club.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	40020.000	40029.900				And Shenhua's only reason for being obstructive is financial gain.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	40030.000	40039.900				Whatever is not profitable for Shenhua, they don't do; whatever only brings small profits, Shenhua don't do, either.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	40040.000	40049.900				In this, the skillful profit calculation of Shanghai natives is completely exposed.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	50010.000	50019.900				"We definitely won't release him. At the moment we have no intention whatsoever of releasing him." Shenhua, which has been using delaying tactics all along in Sun Xiang's transfer, can hold back no more. Yesterday general manager Wu Jinan, under extreme pressure from all sides, made an explicit statement.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	60010.000	60019.900				Wu Jinan, who is still in Shanghai, said that Shenhua had its own reasons for not releasing Sun Xiang, and that it was a thoughtful decision made after taking all factors into consideration. "Now they suddenly say they want him. We've pretty much completed the plans for our preparations; how can you ask me to release him?	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	60020.000	60029.900				If we let Sun Xiang go, are we going to buy another new left back?	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	60030.000	60039.900				Not only do we not have this budget, but when Sun Xiang returns in June, are we actually still going to let Sun Xiang play?" What Wu Jinan thinks more about is the profits for the Shenhua team itself. Objectively speaking, Shenhua really will lose out to a certain extent in putting together a team.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	70010.000	70019.900				"Yesterday as soon as I got to work I saw that bid: 150,000 euros for a six-month loan of Sun Xiang. According to my analysis and understanding, actually the other party is getting Sun Xiang as an emergency measure. I hear their own defender might be going to defect to the English Premier League. They just see Sun Xiang as a temporary fix." Wu Jinan said explicitly that he did not believe that after six months the other party would pay 1.2 million euros to buy Sun Xiang. "This bid of 1.2 million afterwards seems to be pie in the sky. I'll never see it. If the foreigners have got an emergency, do they really have to come and destroy our base here?" In a fax sent from Holland on Tuesday, Eindhoven suggested first 150,000 euros for a six-month loan, and if both sides are satisfied after six months, a transfer for 1.2 million euros.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	80010.000	80019.900				To Shenhua's way of thinking, the plan Eindhoven suggested, of a six-month loan, damages Shenhua's interests, not only its financial interests, but also its team development.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	80020.000	80029.900				"Am I really going to be able to buy a good foreign player with just this 150,000 euros?	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	80030.000	80039.900				And even if I buy one, do I really have to write into the contract with the foreign player that when Sun Xiang comes back, he has to give up his place to let Sun Xiang play?"	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	90010.000	90019.900				Because of this, Shenhua released a public statement yesterday, stating its three points: first, Shanghai Shenhua Club supports Sun Xiang going to Europe to play at a suitable time; second, the "loan first, then transfer" plan proposed by Eindhoven would have a major impact on the Shenhua team's ((pw)) strategy and arrangements of people; third, Shenhua does not accept the "loan first, then buy" format, and can only accept an immediate 1.2 million euro transfer.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	100010.000	100019.900				Sun Xiang's agent Luo Man expressed frustration at Shenhua's attitude. "Loan first, then transfer -- they don't just do this with Asian players or Chinese players. A lot of European and even American players all enter clubs through this mechanism.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	100020.000	100029.900				In the current European soccer market they aren't throwing money around like they used to. They see any investment as a major issue.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	100030.000	100039.900				I should say that Eindhoven have shown enough good faith.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070111.0430	0	100040.000	100049.900				If you want an immediate transfer -- it's almost very unlikely..."	0	0	0
