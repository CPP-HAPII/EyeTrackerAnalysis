GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	20010.000	20019.900				Yuan Zhou (Beijing scholar) January 9, 2007	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	30010.000	30019.900				Starting from January 1, the Beijing Urban Management Department will, on a comprehensive level, rectify the phenomenon of piling stuff and setting up stalls at public venues, such as public roads, interchanges, and pedestrian crossings, as well as clean up items such as all kinds of non-motorized vehicles that have been long forsaken or are parked against the rules and affect the environmental hygiene and tidiness of the entire city. The haphazard parking and placing of bicycles, motorcycles, etc., will be the focus of improvement this time.	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	40010.000	40019.900				Rectifying the environmental hygiene and tidiness of the entire city is a good thing, and as a citizen, this writer should support it.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	40020.000	40029.900				This is the first city-wide large-scale specialized improvement operation launched by the Beijing Urban Management Department according to the newly revised "Regulations on City Appearance and Environmental Hygiene of Beijing Municipality."	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	40030.000	40039.900				If this operation is able to achieve the anticipated effects and give a new outlook to the environmental hygiene and tidiness of the entire city as a result, this writer is even willing to say that this is a big present the urban management department gave to the citizens at the beginning of 2007, and it is worthy of being accepted with pleasure.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	50010.000	50019.900				However, when "giving a big present" to the citizens, the urban management department also should probably need to earnestly consider or deeply ponder over this question: why are bicycles and motorcycles haphazardly parked and placed, and moreover the places where they are haphazardly parked are mostly long-distance bus stations, metro exits, train station squares, and so on?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	50020.000	50029.900				If a relatively accurate answer is not given to this question, the results of the focus of this rectification operation will not only be greatly discounted, the feelings of the citizens will also be hurt.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	60010.000	60019.900				Xinhua News Agency said in a report that according to their understanding, there are currently a total of 8 million to 10 million bicycles in Beijing city.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	60020.000	60029.900				Today when the air quality of Beijing city is a cause of worry for people, transportation pressure has only an increase instead of decrease, and noise pollution gets more and more serious, what significance does it have for Beijing that its citizens own so many bicycles?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	60030.000	60039.900				This signifies a substantial environmental wealth that has yet to be fully tapped!	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	60040.000	60049.900				Why is this so?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	60050.000	60059.900				The reason is very simple: bicycle is the most environmentally-friendly and most energy-saving transportation.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	70010.000	70019.900				However, based on this writer's observation of the society and my personal experience, as well as the relevant reports of the media, one important reason why this substantial environmental wealth is yet to be fully tapped is that our cities generally lack a kind of public service concept, which is priority for bicycles.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	80010.000	80019.900				If we pay attention and observe, we can very easily discover that at public venues such as long-distance bus stations, metro exits, and train station squares, it is very hard to find a place to store bicycles safely and conveniently.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	80020.000	80029.900				Actually, besides these public venues, it is also more and more difficult for you to find places for storing bicycles at public venues in the city such as public bus stations, department stores, banks, supermarkets, and hotels.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	90010.000	90019.900				Compared to the "car drivers," most of the "cyclists" belong to the middle and low income groups. It is these groups that make most use of public transportation.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	90020.000	90029.900				Starting from January 1, there is up to a 60% discount on the prices of tickets for 447 public bus routes in Beijing if one pays by IC card.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	90030.000	90039.900				The moment this public transportation priority policy was implemented, only in one day on December 31, 2006, did 80,000 Beijing citizens buy an IC card.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	90040.000	90049.900				(January 1, Beijing News) This is the most vivid proof.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	90050.000	90059.900				Even so, between "riding a bicycle" and "taking a bus," most people still want to "ride a bicycle" if the journey is short. First, it is faster; second, it is cheaper; and third, it is more of an exercise.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	100010.000	100019.900				On the one hand, public venues lack safe and convenient places for storing bicycles, and on the other hand, most ordinary citizens prefer to "ride a bicycle" when taking a short journey.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	100020.000	100029.900				Under the effect of these two factors, it can be seen everywhere at public venues, such as long-distance bus stations, metro exits, and train station squares, that bicycles are haphazardly parked, causing a serious impact on the environment of Beijing.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	100030.000	100039.900				Against this background, it is not advisable for the urban management department to start off with one-sidedly improving the hygiene and tidiness of the city, and merely clearing away the bicycles that are haphazardly parked. Instead, it should take a more constructive perspective and think of how to use scientific planning in setting up proper bicycle parking lots at places where there is a serious case of these bicycles being haphazardly parked.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	110010.000	110019.900				Judging from the experience and lessons of developed countries, the most harmonious urban transportation with sustainable development is "bicycles + public buses."	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	110020.000	110029.900				Because of this, the United States and many countries in Europe are not only constructing more and more special bicycle lanes, they also started to have bicycle service stations that are financially subsidized by the government and operated commercially.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	110030.000	110039.900				At the service stations, not only are there safe and convenient safekeeping and repair of bicycles, the cyclists can also enjoy services like showers.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	110040.000	110049.900				In this way, many "car drivers" very soon gave up driving and became "cyclists."	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070109.0008	0	110050.000	110059.900				It can be imagined that if Beijing could do the same, the phenomenon of bicycles being haphazardly parked and placed might disappear on its own without needing special improvement.	0	0	0
