CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	10010.000	10019.900				Basketball Association Says Fans Responsible for "Yiwu Incident;" Decision on Penalties to be Announced Today	0	0	0

CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	30010.000	30019.900				Chinanews, January 16 According to a report in Beijing Youth Daily, Li Yuanwei, director of the China Basketball Administration Center and Hao Guohua, CBA league operations director, last night made a response to the incident last week in Yiwu, Zhejiang, in which fans laid siege to the Fujian Xunxing Men's Basketball Team bus. The Basketball Association believes that the main blame for this disturbance between fans and players lies with some uncivilized fans at the game, and because there is no evidence, they cannot judge that Gong Songlin of the Fujian team made an insulting gesture to the fans.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	30020.000	30029.900				This morning the Basketball Association will hold a meeting to further discuss the specific penalties, and will announce them in the afternoon.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	40010.000	40019.900				Currently the focus in this incident is: did Gong Songlin raise his middle finger and make an insulting gesture to fans during the game?	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	40020.000	40029.900				Gong Songlin himself says he just used his index finger to make a "shush" gesture next to his mouth, telling the fans to keep quiet, and certainly did not insult the fans.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	40030.000	40039.900				Hao Guohua said: "Any penalties must be based on evidence, but because there was no live television broadcast of that game, nor was there live videotaping, it's quite difficult for us to get evidence.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	40040.000	40049.900				Based on the feedback from technical representatives and game observers, we believe that Gong Songlin did not make an improper action during the game."	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	50010.000	50019.900				But the Yiwu stadium had said previously that a fan had made a recording of Gong Songlin raising his middle finger with a digital video camera. To this, Hao Guohua said: "If you have evidence, then give it to us. We are giving them this opportunity, but so far we haven't had anyone hand over evidence to us here." Because of this, Gong Songlin will not receive any penalty.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	60010.000	60019.900				Li Yuanwei also said: "The most important thing in giving penalties is that there must be evidence. According to the requirements of the Basketball Association, every stadium must provide a video recording of its games. But for the Zhejiang-Fujian game not only was there no live television broadcast, they also didn't provide a video recording after the game. Strictly speaking, this is also the responsibility of the Yiwu stadium.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	60020.000	60029.900				But earlier a teacher from a university in Zhejiang phoned us. He testified that Gong Songlin really was raising his index finger, and was willing to make a statement when necessary.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	60030.000	60039.900				If there is evidence that Gong Songlin really did raise his middle finger, then we don't exclude the possibility of pursuing penalties."	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	70010.000	70019.900				"I think the main responsibility for this incident lies with the uncivilized behavior of a few fans," said Hao Guohua. "That day the Zhejiang team won the match and the fans were still this angry -- this is something I don't understand at all."	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	80010.000	80019.900				Recently there has been a spate of incidents of clashes between fans and players, including the Shandong team's foreign player Tuck having been spat in his face by a fan in Changchun, and Zhejiang fans abusing Fujian's Gong Songlin and laying siege to the Fujian team's bus after the match.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	80020.000	80029.900				Hao Guohua said: "I think this incident was mostly caused by uncivilized behavior by fans and inadequate security arrangements at the stadium.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	80030.000	80039.900				The behavior of some fans at some stadiums is not good. This is something we can't control." He also said: "From now on we will tell the players to pay attention to their own conduct, and also require all the stadiums to improve their security arrangements to ensure the players' safety."	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	90010.000	90019.900				Because of this, the Yiwu stadium will definitely receive a penalty. Hao Guohua said that the Basketball Association will hold a meeting to further discuss and make a decision on the penalty this morning. But it would certainly not be cancellation of Yiwu's license to be a match venue, like the previous cancellation of the Zhuji stadium's license to hold matches.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070116.0725	0	90020.000	90029.900				He said: "Licenses to hold matches are only canceled in the situation where this kind of serious problem has occurred more than twice." (Zhou He)	0	0	0
