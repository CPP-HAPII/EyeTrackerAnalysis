First, the ban on weekend chartered flights will be lifted in July, and normal daily chartered flights may be in place before the end of the year; however, they could possibly be implemented ahead of time depending on how talks between Taiwan and the mainland go and on the market's reactions.	0	0	0		statement
PDA_CMN_20080418.0014.sgm	0	3050.000	3100.000	TEXT1	unknown	unkown	In the future there will definitely be a push for regular cross-Strait flights, which can also be extended. That is, after Taiwanese aircraft arrive in the mainland, they could continue flying to another destination. After mainland aircraft fly to Taiwan, they could also fly on to other destinations. This means tremendous room for development for people in the air transport industry.	0	0	0		statement
