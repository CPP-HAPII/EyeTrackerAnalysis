GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	30010.000	30019.900				Soon after New Year's day for 2007 went by, German Chancellor Merkel paid a brief work visit of only four hours to the United States on January 4.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	30020.000	30029.900				According to a report, a highlight of Merkel's visit was to introduce to US President Bush the concept of a "common internal market between the EU and the US."	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	30030.000	30039.900				This undoubtedly is a New Year's present from Merkel to Bush.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	40010.000	40019.900				During the visit, Merkel briefed Bush on the work plan of Germany as the rotating president of the European Union and the G8 in 2007, as well as laid the groundwork for the EU-US summit that will be held this April.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	40020.000	40029.900				The concept of a "common internal market between the EU and the US" will be an important topic at the EU-US summit.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	50010.000	50019.900				Different from the "transatlantic free trade zone" that came to a premature end in the mid 1990s, what the "common internal market between the EU and the US" emphasizes on is not free trade but the establishment of common laws and technical standards within the economic field, thereby reducing trade barriers between the EU and the US as well as cutting trading costs incurred by differences in standards, laws, and regulations, in order to achieve the objectives of integrating the EU and US markets and expanding the EU and US economies.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	60010.000	60019.900				Analysts think that this pragmatic approach by Merkel to take small steps is appropriate to the fact that currently between the EU and the US there still exists internal distrust, which precisely had caused the failure of the EU-US free trade zone in the past.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	70010.000	70019.900				In recent years, under the dual effects of realistic needs and historical tradition, the political rift between the EU and the US caused by the Iraq war is gradually closing up. The two sides are more and more willing to maintain the traditional transatlantic alliance.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	70020.000	70029.900				In comparison with improved political relations, the EU and the US are looking forward to a new economic turning point.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	80010.000	80019.900				The EU and the US, the two most important large trading zones in the world, account for 72% of the global GNP.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	80020.000	80029.900				However, conflicts often arise between them, and trade sanctions are not uncommon.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	80030.000	80039.900				Judging from the causes for EU-US trade frictions, the difference in laws, regulations, and technical standards is an important factor.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	80040.000	80049.900				In a special interview with Financial Times Deutschland, Merkel said that the different regulations that the EU and the US have in the field of patent protection gave rise to a lot of trade friction between the two sides.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	80050.000	80059.900				As such, her proposal of a "common internal market between the EU and the US" this time can be said to have hit the mark.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	80060.000	80069.900				When the EU and the US launch negotiations for the transatlantic economic framework agreement to remove trade barriers, it will surely stimulate the positive development in the EU-US economic relationship. Germany, as the "world's biggest exporter," will definitely stand to gain from this.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	90010.000	90019.900				Although Merkel stressed that the establishment of a "common internal market between the EU and the US" is not directed at any third country, the strategic importance of this common internal market is absolutely not to be underestimated, given the decisive roles that the EU and the US play in the global economy.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	100010.000	100019.900				The EU and the US hope to increase their competitiveness in the global economy through a leaders' alliance.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	100020.000	100029.900				However, whether the economic cooperation between the two powers, the EU and the US, will lead to new trade barriers and what influence the economic advantages of the EU and the US will have on global free trade are still unknown at this moment.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070113.0009	0	100030.000	100039.900				But no matter what, the EU and the US have made another attempt to integrate the regional economy. This surely serves as an inspiration for other regions in setting up their internal markets.	0	0	0
