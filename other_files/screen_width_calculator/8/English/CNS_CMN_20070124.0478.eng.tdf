CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	30010.000	30019.900				"To a certain degree, Japan's agriculture is a flop." At the recent "Summit on Construction of New Villages," an event of CCTV's "People of the Year for the Three Dimensional Rural Issues" series, Dang Guoying, an expert on agricultural issues from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that if Japan's experience is used to solve the three dimensional rural issues of China, bigger problems will arise.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	40010.000	40019.900				At this forum organized by the China Agriculture Film and Television Center, many experts on agricultural issues, as well as leaders of agricultural enterprises, said that the construction of new villages in China is a "long-term heavy responsibility."	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	40020.000	40029.900				According to our understanding, in order to solve the three dimensional rural issues China is facing, various levels of officials have gone to agriculturally developed countries to observe and learn. Just as what Beijing Municipal Mayor Wang Qishan has said, "Even the milk cows in Australia know some of our officials."	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	50010.000	50019.900				After many experts and officials observed the experiences of overseas countries, they are more in favor of Japan's experiences.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	50020.000	50029.900				They think that Japan's situation of a big population and little land matches more with the reality of that in China.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	50030.000	50039.900				However, Dang Guoying has higher praises for Holland's experiences. Holland has a population of 15 million and an agricultural population of 500,000. It has a per capita cultivated area of less than 0.9 mu, but is the second largest agricultural product exporter, right after the United States.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	60010.000	60019.900				Dang Guoying said that although the per capita cultivated area of Holland is twice that of Japan, Dutch farms (including animal husbandry farms and greenhouse farms) have an average cultivated area eight times that of Japan.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	60020.000	60029.900				Of this, the size of Dutch animal husbandry farms is about 15 times that of Japan.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	70010.000	70019.900				Japan has many part-time farmers and only 14% full-time farms; on average, there is not even one labor unit for each farm. On the other hand, there are mainly specialized farms in Holland, and each farm has about two labor units on average.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	80010.000	80019.900				Furthermore, although Holland has only 200,000 workers who engage directly in animal husbandry and fishery, the whole nation has close to 120,000 people working in the food industry and 460,000 people in the related departments.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	80020.000	80029.900				About 1/6 of the nation's job positions and 1/5 of its export volume come from the agricultural product processing industry.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	80030.000	80039.900				A developed animal husbandry industry is an important foundation for Holland's agricultural product processing industry. Its output value is much higher than that of field crop and plant cultivation.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	80040.000	80049.900				In comparison, Japan's animal husbandry industry and agricultural product processing industry are more backward.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	90010.000	90019.900				China should follow Holland's footsteps in agricultural industrialization and farmers' specialization, rather than that of Japan's in having a small-scale peasant economy and part-time farmers.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070124.0478	0	90020.000	90029.900				Dang Guoying said that lack of competitiveness in current Japanese agriculture should be taken as a warning for us.	0	0	0
