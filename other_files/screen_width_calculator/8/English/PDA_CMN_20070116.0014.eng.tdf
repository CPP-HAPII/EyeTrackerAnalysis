Therefore, when he was alive, he repeatedly told the media and friends, "I have instructed my son that when I pass away in the future, he does not need to inform the relatives. He should scatter my ashes into the sea after cremation to save some trouble."	0	0	0

As we can see, his son wanted to follow his father's last wish and to remember his father in a low-key manner. In addition, Anderson Junior also forwarded his phone to the message box and did not reply even when the box was full, which he hardly does. It is reckoned that he has gone to Britain to handle Uncle Wah's funeral arrangements.	0	0	0
