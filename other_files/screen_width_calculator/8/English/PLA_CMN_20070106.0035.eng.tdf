PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	10010.000	10019.900				I Refuse to Let Brigade Commander Use the Restroom	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	20010.000	20019.900				Zhang Jianping, squad leader of the second company of a brigade in Lanzhou Military Area Command (Source: PLA Daily 3rd edition, Dispatch time: January 6, 2007 06:27)	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	30010.000	30019.900				All soldiers had stood sentry. Everyone has a deep impression of the scene of his first sentry duty.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	30020.000	30029.900				However, my first sentry duty was different from others'.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	30030.000	30039.900				Why was it so?	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	30040.000	30049.900				It is somewhat shameful when talk about it. My first sentry post was a very special place - restroom.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	40010.000	40019.900				The barrack zone of our brigade was built at the foot of the mountain. At that time, there were only a few aqua privies. No drains were laid so we had to clean out the dung regularly.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	40020.000	40029.900				It happened that our company was the closest to the restroom in the east, thus maintaining the restroom sanitation became our company's 'glorious and tough' duty.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	40030.000	40039.900				When I first arrived at the company, I had 'opinion' about this matter. How could it be so backward in such age!	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	40040.000	40049.900				Therefore, every time new comrades-in-arms all vied with each other to clean the restroom, I did not act enthusiastically.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	50010.000	50019.900				Shortly after, the brigade notified us that a chief would come to inspect our work soon and asked our company to make sure that the restroom was clean.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	50020.000	50029.900				On that day, we did an unannounced cleaning. The company also decided to send a 'secret sentry' to safeguard the cleanliness of the restroom and only allowed people to use the restroom at certain time.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	50030.000	50039.900				What was more abominable was that the job actually 'befell' me. Since I was normally bold and outspoken, the company thus decided to make me serve as this 'villain'.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	60010.000	60019.900				Despite my discontent, my sense of responsibility was rather strong. Therefore, I stood in front of the restroom like a small poplar.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	60020.000	60029.900				However, when the company commander saw this, he said that it would not work and that I needed to stand 'secret sentry' to avoid letting the chief know that we set up sentry here intentionally.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	60030.000	60039.900				I had no choice but to pick up a broom and pretended to clean the restroom.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	70010.000	70019.900				The chief did not come on the first day.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	70020.000	70029.900				Early the second day, after the comrades-in-arms finished cleaning the restroom, I got into the 'sentry post' again.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	70030.000	70039.900				Soon afterwards, a middle-aged man in sportswear entered the restroom.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	70040.000	70049.900				I judged by my intuition that this was a family member who came to visit relative in the troops. Therefore, I quickly accosted him and said, "Sir, I am sorry but you cannot use the restroom today." The middle-aged man was dumbfounded, "How come?" "The senior officers will conduct an inspection here so our company has a rule that it can only be used after the inspection."	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	80010.000	80019.900				"So you are standing special sentry here?" Once he brought up this subject, I suddenly became angry, "Exactly. I bet you haven't seen my type of sentry before.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	80020.000	80029.900				You see, this restroom does not have drain. Since the leaders are coming to inspect, the company then set a specific time for us to go to the restroom together." The middle-aged man finished listening to my gripe patiently. He cooperated with my job greatly and turned to leave.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	90010.000	90019.900				After breakfast, the messenger Xiao Li suddenly came to inform me to 'pull out from sentry'. He looked at me sympathetically, "You are so muddle-headed. Why didn't you let the brigade commander use the restroom this morning?"	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	100010.000	100019.900				My goodness, the middle-aged man turned out to be the brigade commander!	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	100020.000	100029.900				I was so afraid that I rushed to find the company commander to admit my mistake.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	100030.000	100039.900				To my surprise, the company commander did not criticize me but said that his work method was off base instead. He added that the brigade commander praised me; the 'restroom sentry', in the phone.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	100040.000	100049.900				Even though my first sentry experience was rather disgraceful, our restroom renovation work actually began a few days later!	0	0	0

PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	130010.000	130019.900				Fortunately, this 'muddle-headed' restroom sentry had reflected the situation to 'Mr. Brigade Commander', otherwise, not only would the renovation not happen to the restroom, the thinking of making symbolic gestures of some cadres would not be reformed either.	0	0	0		
PLA_CMN_20070106.0035	0	140010.000	140019.900				This incident at least told us three laws: First, senior officers paying calls to the officers and men must perform their duties in a committed manner and understand the situation in order to relieve impediments and ease worries for the officers and men; second, troop commanders should serve as good first teachers for new soldiers and never allow bad practices to spread in the army camp; third, new comrades-in-arms should have the courage to uphold correct opinions and use their élan to counterbalance the lethargy of individual old comrades.	0	0	0
