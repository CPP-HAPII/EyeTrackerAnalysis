CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	30010.000	30019.900				In recent years, two brothers in Germany named Karl Albrecht and Theo Albrecht have been listed among the richest people in Europe every year.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	30020.000	30029.900				Moreover, in the past ten-plus years, the two brothers also climbed steadily up the US Forbes' list of the richest people.	0	0	0

CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	60010.000	60019.900				As a matter of fact, the two Albrecht brothers, who manage the "poor man's stores," Aldi (Aldi-Market) chain supermarkets, can be considered the richest in Germany.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	60020.000	60029.900				However, they hardly appear on media or in public, making it rather difficult for ordinary people to know what immense wealth means to them.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	70010.000	70019.900				Rose to Wealth with "Poor Man's Stores"	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	80010.000	80019.900				The Albrecht brothers were born to a family of an ordinary miner in Germany.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	80020.000	80029.900				At that time, their father was working in a bakery, and their mother owned a little food store of 35 square meters in a residential area for miners in their hometown, Essen. The family had very meager income.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	90010.000	90019.900				After graduating from middle school, the two brothers, determined to change the financial situation of their family, each became apprentice at a food store owned by other people.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	90020.000	90029.900				However, World War II cut short the career they just started: Theo Albrecht went to Africa as a reservist, while Karl was sent to the war on the Eastern front as a regular.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	90030.000	90039.900				When World War II ended in 1946, the two brothers returned to their hometown and opened a food store.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	90040.000	90049.900				Their first batch of customers was, of course, local consumers who had little money and could not even afford adequate food and clothing.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	90050.000	90059.900				So, they sold butter at the lowest market price then, and sales was very good.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	90060.000	90069.900				Very soon, they set up branches near big supermarkets that had many customers.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	90070.000	90079.900				The two brothers simply gave up selling fresh food and concentrated on the sales of food that was easy to store and did not go bad within a short period of time.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	90080.000	90089.900				It did not take long for this idea of low-price discount store to be proven successful, with chain stores springing up like mushrooms in the Ruhr industrial region.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	90090.000	90099.900				By the late 1950s, they had more than 300 chain supermarkets, and the annual sales volume topped 100 million marks within a short period of time.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	100010.000	100019.900				In 1962, the first Aldi supermarket in the "real sense" opened in Dortmund. The name of the store "Aldi" was formed with the first two letters of the last name "Albrecht" (Albrecht) and the word "discount" (Discount).	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	100020.000	100029.900				Compared with other stores, the greatest feature of the Aldi chain stores is its low prices. Even when converted to Renminbi, the prices of most goods are still very low relative to the income level of Chinese people today.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	100030.000	100039.900				When converted to Renminbi, the prices of some daily consumer items sold in the store throughout the year are, for instance, 1.80 yuan for one kilogram of flour, 3.50 yuan for a one-liter carton of pure apple juice, and three yuan for a one-liter carton of milk.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	100040.000	100049.900				Yet Germany has a per capita GNP of more than 20,000 US dollars.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	100050.000	100059.900				Right now, Aldi has a total of more than 6,000 outlets in 12 countries outside Germany, including the United States, and is expanding rapidly at the rate of opening up at least one new outlet every week.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	110010.000	110019.900				No wonder Forbes once exclaimed: If both the Albrecht brothers are not already more than 80 years old, in a few years they might surpass Gates to be the richest in the world.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	120010.000	120019.900				Cheap Things Can Be Good	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	130010.000	130019.900				Although "low prices" is what Aldi built itself upon, for Aldi to have grown rapidly and won large numbers of customers in the last decades in European countries and the US, where customers are extremely picky and competition is almost brutal, low prices are not the only thing it counts on.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	140010.000	140019.900				The Albrecht brothers know very well that doubt which accopanies people's love of cheap goods.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	140020.000	140029.900				Because of this, when Aldi procures goods, it always provides its own quality standards to its suppliers. Besides assigning its own staff to carry out inspection, the company also hires third-party inspection agencies to test the quality of goods.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	140030.000	140039.900				Once a product fails the spot inspection, it will be taken off the supply list without hesitation. The supplier will not only lose a large client, but also has to pay a huge sum of compensation.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	140040.000	140049.900				If dissatisfied with a product they've bought, customers don't need to state any reason and Aldi will refund the money.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	140050.000	140059.900				As Aldi has a high and stable demand, a manufacturer will definitely have an easy time once it is selected as its designated supplier.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	140060.000	140069.900				There is this saying circulating among suppliers: Fighting for the long-term supply contract with Aldi is as difficult as striving to qualify for Germany's Bundesliga; being forsaken by Aldi is worse than being betrayed by someone.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	150010.000	150019.900				In addition, different from many famous large-scale supermarkets in the world, Aldi chain supermarkets strictly control the number of their product varieties.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	150020.000	150029.900				At present, Aldi SÃ¼d chain supermarkets limit the supply of their goods to less than 600 varieties, whereas Aldi Nord chain supermarkets have below 750 varieties of goods.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	150030.000	150039.900				Here is the origin of this interesting practice: When the company first started in 1950, only a few products could be provided on the supply list. Based on the conditions at that time, only by keeping everything simple could further growth be ensured.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	160010.000	160019.900				The Albrecht brothers had planned to gradually increase the variety of goods, but they did not do so in the end.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	160020.000	160029.900				Because they realized when there was a small variety of goods, sales volume went up instead.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	160030.000	160039.900				Moreover, by doing this, the operation cost was much lower compared with similar food chain stores.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	170010.000	170019.900				Tracing back to 2002 when Germany and the West in general were suffering from a slow economy, but Aldi, the chain supermarket that targeted at poor people, was having exceptionally good days.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	170020.000	170029.900				The reason beneath this goes without saying: the worse the economic situation in society gets, the less money people will have in their pockets; and with less money in their pockets, people will have a greater need for quality goods at low prices.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070131.0064	0	170030.000	170039.900				To Albrecht's mom, there is nothing simpler than this truth: "The tougher people's lives get, the easier our lives become." Today, what the two elderly brothers often think of is probably this famous saying of their mother.	0	0	0
