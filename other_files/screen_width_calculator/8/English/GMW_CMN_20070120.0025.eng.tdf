GMW_CMN_20070120.0025	0	40020.000	40029.900				Although the Lixin Academy had not received the approval by the civil administration department, it did have a permit to set up a school issued by the Chongqing municipal education committee. As stipulated in the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Promotion of Privately-run Schools," private schools and private education organizations must be licensed by the education department. Their enrollment guidelines and advertisements must also be submitted to the licensing organization to be put on record.	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070120.0025	0	50020.000	50029.900				After getting its "birth permit," the actual operational situation of Lixin Academy was "unmonitored on both sides." The Chongqing municipal education committee division leader says that day-to-day affairs such as teaching and student recruitment should have been monitored by the education committee of Shapingbei District in Chongqing, where Lixin Academy was located.	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070120.0025	0	50040.000	50049.900				The "unclear management" of Lixin Academy by education committees at both municipal and district level gave an opportunity to Yang Hua.	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070120.0025	0	50060.000	50069.900				The school never complied. Chongqing municipal education committee didn't pursue the school's responsibilities, nor has it intervened in the school's unauthorized recruitment of students.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070120.0025	0	60010.000	60019.900				Alas! How could the main education supervisory department, charged with very important responsibilities, fail to carry them out in this way, causing consequences of such seriousness? Now that things have come this far, you want to clear yourself of your responsibilities. Can the general public let you?	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070120.0025	0	70030.000	70039.900				It really is divine intervention that Yang Hua's actions were brought to light and that he has gone to jail. Otherwise, who knows how many more people would be cheated?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070120.0025	0	70040.000	70049.900				Might I ask, how many more cases like this are there in the country?	0	0	0
