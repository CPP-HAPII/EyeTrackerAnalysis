GMW_CMN_20070110.0366	0	40010.000	40019.900				At the end of the 19th century, Coubertin, who was dedicated to social reform, tried to establish new educational methods for the arrival of the new century, in order to establish "shared values and strength for humanity" and to promote world peace.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070110.0366	0	40020.000	40029.900				Among the many traditional sporting cultural patterns, he thought the "Olympics," which served as a system for social regulation in ancient Greece, came closest to his ideals.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070110.0366	0	40030.000	40039.900				Coubertin told his supporters: "What I am reviving of the Olympics is not its ancient format. Rather it is the discovery of the central role of education for our country and for humanity. In this age of technological revolution and the international spread of democracy, I am doing my utmost to bring it back because I have found that for modern man it is the support for his intelligence, the support for his morality, and, to a certain extent, the support for his religion." Starting from this goal, Coubertin thought that the modern Olympics should have three basic characteristics:	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070110.0366	0	80010.000	80019.900				Coubertin said that the fundamental difference between the Olympics and the world championships was that it not only pursues the technical value of competition, but more importantly, it pursues the moral value of competition.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070110.0366	0	80020.000	80029.900				"Only when the level of the participant's 'athlete's character' shows improvement in the field of moral values can (the Olympics) achieve full success."	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070110.0366	0	80030.000	80039.900				The mission of the modern Olympic Games is to widely promote the basic tenets of Olympism: that is, the "faster, higher, stronger" spirit of transcendence, the spirit of competition "giving priority to participation," the cooperative spirit of fair competition, the international spirit of peace, friendship, and progress, and the democratic spirit of equality and openness, etc. "Transplant them from the regional environment to the whole environment; transfer them from special kinds of activities into all of an individual's activities."	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070110.0366	0	90030.000	90039.900				It is these ideals that made the Olympic Games a socio-cultural phenomenon with global impact that transcends racial differences, national differences, and religious differences.	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070110.0366	0	100020.000	100029.900				(Provided by Civilization Magazine Press) However, in the more than 100 years of history of the modern Olympic Games, the target values that Coubertin chose have often faced challenges in the survival and development of the Olympic Games.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070110.0366	0	100030.000	100039.900				Particularly since the 1980s, with the continuing expansion of the groups of participants in the Olympic Games, the competition among different participating groups seeking to maximize their own profits has produced clashes among the value orientations of various interest groups. Also, the ever-growing control of multinational corporations and the mass media, and the over-ambitious hopes for Olympics to promote economic development of every city that holds them (or city that bids for holding them) are leading the Olympic Games gradually away from its initial value choices. A trend of alienation has appeared in their development.	0	0	0

Rogge, current president of the International Olympic Committee, also made the following declaration in his inauguration speech: "The motto of the Olympics is faster, higher, and stronger.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070110.0366	0	110020.000	110029.900				Of course we will continue to keep this motto, but with the new century coming, perhaps it is necessary for sport to have a new motto, that is: cleaner, more human, and more united."	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070110.0366	0	110030.000	110039.900				The wish for reform expressed by the two presidents fully embodies the International Olympic Committee's engagement with the problems faced by the contemporary Olympic Games.	0	0	0

In the final analysis it is the problems of choice of value orientations of the Olympic Games, the choice of development models and the choice of interest groups, and at its core is again the problem of "the crisis of humanity."	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070110.0366	0	120020.000	120029.900				The 2008 Beijing Olympics will fly high the flag of the "human Olympics." It is a call to return the Olympics to its humanist traditions.
