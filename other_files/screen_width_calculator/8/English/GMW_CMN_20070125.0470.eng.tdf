GMW_CMN_20070125.0470	0	50020.000	50029.900				In addition, key energy and mineral product prices on the international market continued to run at a high level, lifting the customs tax base and also pushing up the increase in customs tax revenue. Secondly, the quality of customs revenue collection was further improved. Thirdly, the customs body vigorously launched a regional and industry-based campaign against smuggling, focusing on combating the false reporting of prices. This has served as an effective deterrent to law breakers, upholding the normal order in import and export trade, and creating a positive law-enforcement environment for the collection and management of tax revenue.	0	0	0
