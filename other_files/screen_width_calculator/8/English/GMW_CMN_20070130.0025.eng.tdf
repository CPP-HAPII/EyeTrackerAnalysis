GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	30010.000	30019.900				Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference Wang Yushi submitted a proposal to the Fifth Session of the Ninth Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference suggesting that supervision of golf club members among civil servants should be stepped up in order to fight corruption and promote a clean government.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	30020.000	30029.900				He argued that for ordinary salaried workers, playing golf is something that they dare not dream of because it is an extravagant sport for the moneybags. Ordinary people simply cannot afford the high cost.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	30030.000	30039.900				Let's take the membership card that a Nanjing golf club introduces as an example. The least expensive personal card cost six hundred sixty thousand yuan per card while the most expensive corporate card cost 2.64 million yuan. In addition, each card charges an annual fee of 4,000 yuan.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	30040.000	30049.900				However, we frequently see civil servants who are wage-earners as well on the golf course. Is this phenomenon normal?	0	0	0

GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	40010.000	40019.900				A media report claimed that many of the approximately 2,000 people in Hainan Province who are keen on the sport are Party and government cadres.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	40020.000	40029.900				Secretary of Changsha County Party Committee Li Zhen'e actually 'died in the line of duty' at the golf course.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	40030.000	40039.900				According to information, many cadres in Jiangsu are also golf club members.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	40040.000	40049.900				Even though a staff at a renowned golf club declined to reveal customers' information to the reporter, he admitted that civil servant is their major client group. "It is not only for making profits. Sometimes, we invite them on our own accord for all kinds of convenience and the club image."	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	50010.000	50019.900				Committee Wang Yushi believed that it is very possible that someone 'foot the bill' for civil servants who participate in extravagant activities such as playing golf. It is hard not to suspect the acceptance of bribery.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	50020.000	50029.900				Therefore, in his proposal, he suggested discipline inspection commission and supervisory departments to conduct in-depth investigations into the phenomenon of civil servants playing golf. They should also enact and earnestly implement corresponding anti-corruption and promotion of clean government disciplines in order to step up the supervision of golf club members among civil servants.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	50030.000	50039.900				If necessary, they can ask procuratorial organs to start the investigation into civil servants on the golf club member registers, especially the suspicion of accepting bribes by leading cadres of the Party and the government.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	60010.000	60019.900				Investigating corruption of civil servants from golf club members is a good idea.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	60020.000	60029.900				We can also derive other anti-corruption means from this.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	60030.000	60039.900				For instance, some civil servants frequent high-class hotels, indulge in dissipation, lean on moneybags, and have casual relationships with women. Where does the funding of their spending come from?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	60040.000	60049.900				Some civil servants are very young and their salaries low but they spend money lavishly. They either buy sumptuous villas or top-grade sedans. Where do they get all this cash?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	60050.000	60059.900				Some civil servants neither have overseas background nor too much legitimate income. How can they send their children to study overseas at their own expense? Why do they have such strong financial strength?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	60060.000	60069.900				...In regard to these abnormal phenomena, the discipline inspection commission and supervisory departments have the authority and responsibility to find out the answers. They can either take the initiative to question them, or to travel incognito to listen to reactions of surrounding people, or to adopt proper measures in accordance with relevant regulations to conduct in-depth investigations.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	70010.000	70019.900				Relying on informants to uncover an offense and provide clues is no doubt an important breakthrough point in anti-corruption work. However, one can also find traces of corruption through the extravagant life and many abnormal high-consumption behaviors of cadres.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	70020.000	70029.900				Didn't we stress that we have to move the anti-corruption gateway forward? I believe to conduct in-depth investigation resolutely into civil servants' participation in extravagant activities such as playing golf is unquestionably much more proactive than acting on tips.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	70030.000	70039.900				In order to fight corruption, ideas should be extended and pre-emptive measures should be taken. We cannot wait until people are rotten to the core and even escape overseas before investigation and prosecution takes place.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070130.0025	0	70040.000	70049.900				If so, then not only is it too late, the losses caused to the Party and the people are also too huge.	0	0	0
