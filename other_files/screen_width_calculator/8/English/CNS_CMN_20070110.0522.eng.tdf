CNS_CMN_20070110.0522	0	40010.000	40019.900				Despite widespread complaints, why are so many stores still greatly interested in "rebate promotion?"	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070110.0522	0	40020.000	40029.900				It turns out that the stores can benefit from both sides this way.	0	0	0

CNS_CMN_20070110.0522	0	50010.000	50019.900				Looking at the current situation, retailers, that is, stores, usually charge suppliers a variety of fees such as promotion fee, advertising fee, bar code fee, outfit fee, management fee, personnel service fee, and premium shelf fee, among which the promotion fee gives rise to the most prominent conflict. "If such fees are not allowed, these activities will not be carried out," said a relevant authority from the Economic Inspection Division of Xicheng Branch Administration of Industry and Commerce. This measure aims to change the extremely unfair positions of retailers and suppliers so as to fundamentally reduce the "rebate promotion" activities that the stores are crazy about.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070110.0522	0	60010.000	60019.900				This responsible person said that at present large stores in Xicheng District have all adopted the operation mode of "attracting manufacturers to enter the store." Usually suppliers will have to offer 25%-30% of the total sales to stores as discount points, and if consumers participating in stores' "rebate promotion" have purchased any goods with coupons, stores will again get discount points.	0	0	0

CNS_CMN_20070110.0522	0	60040.000	60049.900				In fact, the part subtracted by stores is ultimately absorbed by consumers, so it is obvious that consumers actually will not get any real benefit in the promotion activities."	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070110.0522	0	70010.000	70019.900				"Under such situation, suppliers have no choice but to participate in the promotion." The responsible person said that suppliers and retailers are in extremely unfair positions. If suppliers do not participate in the promotion, they are not even eligible to gain entry into the stores.	0	0	0		
CNS_CMN_20070110.0522	0	70020.000	70029.900				"Therefore, among the various fees stores charge suppliers, the promotion fee must be banned."	0	0	0

"This method is supposed to achieve a good result after implementation; however, as it is relatively foresighted, the experiment is conducted in Xicheng according to the deployment of the Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce. Once it proves successful, it will be implemented throughout the city."	0	0	0
