It is precisely this political consciousness which has caused him to disregard personal gains and losses and unhesitatingly enter the dangerous profession of scientific research flight testing. He has struggled tenaciously to change the backward situation of our national air defense scientific research and to accelerate modernization of the People's Air Force. It is also this political consciousness which has caused him to remain committed to his great ambition despite years of encountering dangers in the blue sky and even the threat of death. His aim has not wavered in the face of temptations from various materialistic gains in society.	0	0	0
