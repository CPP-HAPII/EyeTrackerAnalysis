CNS_CMN_20070129.0176	0	40010.000	40019.900				General Liao Xilong, member of the Central Military Commission, director of the Leading Group for the Work on Auditing Economic Responsibility of the Army's Leading Cadres, and director of the General Logistics Department, pointed out at the session that comprehensive supervision will be applied on the investment orientation, investment amount, planning, execution, and utilization effects of the military wars preparation funds. Problems discovered will be rectified immediately to ensure all war constructions can withstand the tests of wars and history. Supervision and inspection on the economic decision-making authority, expense approval authority, and fund utilization authority of leading cadres will be reinforced by carrying out serious investigation and prosecution on people and things that are against laws and disciplines, and by constantly promoting the development of a work style for the team of leading cadres. Focusing on problems such as insufficient support, insufficient linkages, non-implementation, and non-standardization of the operations of the military economic reform policies and systems, analysis and research will be strengthened to propose countermeasure suggestions and promote a healthy development of the reform. The management ability and level of all levels of leaders must be constantly improved and the establishment and perfection of the long-term mechanism for scientific management must be promoted to truly find a way to construct army modernization more effectively and with fewer investments.	0	0	0
