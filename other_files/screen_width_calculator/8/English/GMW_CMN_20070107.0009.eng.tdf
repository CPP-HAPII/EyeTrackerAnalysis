GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	10010.000	10019.900				Pay Attention to Population Decrease From Now On	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	20010.000	20019.900				Cheng Yawen, January 7, 2007	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	30010.000	30019.900				From now on till 2050, China's population will not always keep increasing, but will go through a process of initial increase, followed by decrease.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	40010.000	40019.900				The 2006 world population statistics of the US Population Reference Bureau show that among the top ten countries with the highest population, China ranks first with 1.31 billion. However, the interesting thing is that it also forecasts that in 2050, China's population will only increase by slightly more than 100 million to reach 1.44 billion, making it second in the world right after India.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	40020.000	40029.900				On the other hand, in the latest World Population Prospectus published by the United Nations, it is forecasted that China's population by 2050 will be 1.39 billion.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	40030.000	40039.900				These two forecasts are rather thought-provoking.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	50010.000	50019.900				China's population is currently still on the rise. It is generally estimated that in another 20 years, which is about 2026, China's population will reach a peak of about 1.5 billion.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	50020.000	50029.900				If China's population is 1.44 billion, or lower at 1.39 billion by 2050, this will mean that from now on until 2050, China's population will not always keep increasing but will go through a process of initial increase, followed by decrease.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	60010.000	60019.900				This estimate is, of course, based on the current fertility level of the Chinese people.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	60020.000	60029.900				From a long-term perspective, whether the population of a country can increase or not depends on its total fertility rate.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	60030.000	60039.900				Only when the total fertility rate reaches 2.1-2.2, which means a woman of the right age gives birth to at least two children on average in her lifetime, can the need for generation replacement be maintained so as to prevent the total population from falling.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	60040.000	60049.900				Judging from the results of the two national population censuses as well as all kinds of other statistical information obtained since the 90s of the last century, China's fertility rate is now significantly lower than the generation replacement level.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	60050.000	60059.900				The figure announced by the relevant department is 1.8. Even when based on this figure, it is still lower than the 2.0 of the United States and even lower than the 2.3 of India.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	60060.000	60069.900				On the other hand, the results of the fifth population census in 2000 show that if the "non-declared" group of 24.2 million people, who aroused much controversy, was not counted, the total fertility rate of our country in 2000 would only be 1.22. This is far from the 2.1-2.2 needed for the generation replacement level. This surprised the demographic scholars, departments in charge of birth control, and even the public.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	70010.000	70019.900				However, many local demographic scholars and relevant research institutes believe that this figure has a high validity.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	70020.000	70029.900				Various objective data show that after the mid 90s of the last century, the total fertility rate of mainland Chinese women has become lower than 1.3 to be at the same level as that of Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and the Taiwan region of China.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	70030.000	70039.900				And in the 70s of the last century, this figure was 6.0. At that time, China was in a birth peak.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	70040.000	70049.900				However, since the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the total fertility rate of Chinese women has been lower than the generation replacement level.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	80010.000	80019.900				Since a long time ago, the phenomenon of men and women of appropriate age in major Chinese cities having low desire to give birth and a low actual fertility rate is actually no longer a secret, but a fact known to all.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	80020.000	80029.900				However, many people probably still do not expect that the birth concept of the rural population has also experienced drastic changes in about the last 20 years.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	80030.000	80039.900				People who are familiar with rural life know that in these years, the number of rural elementary schools and high schools keeps decreasing, with some closing down and some merging.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	80040.000	80049.900				This is a clear proof that the new birth population in Chinese villages is falling rapidly.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	80050.000	80059.900				In many regions in China's countryside, it is already very common to have one child per family; on the contrary, it is rare to see a family raising more than two children.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	90010.000	90019.900				The above situation also causes China to quickly go from the second type of population replacement to the third population type.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	90020.000	90029.900				This means that only in about 30 years, has it made a transition to the low-birth, low-death, and low-growth in the 90s of the 20th century, after China's population changed from the conventional high-birth, high-death, and low-growth to high-birth, low-death, and high-growth in the 50s and 60s of the last century.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	100010.000	100019.900				Out of China's 1.3 billion population today, almost 0.6 billion live in cities and 0.7 billion live in the countryside.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	100020.000	100029.900				With today's urbanization rate below 50%, population replacement in China is totally different from that in the 80s of the last century.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	100030.000	100039.900				What can be predicted is that with China's course of industrialization and urbanization still being accelerated forward, the birth concept of Chinese people in the future will not be the same and the fertility rate will also continue to fall constantly, no matter what adjustments are made to the population policies.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	110010.000	110019.900				Just as what is said by Professor Qiao Xiaochun of Peking University, "After a country enters the industrialization stage, it is possible to bring down the fertility rate, but it is not quite possible to increase the fertility rate that has already been low for a long time."	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	110020.000	110029.900				The experience of countries such as Japan, Russia, and South Korea has already proven this point.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	120010.000	120019.900				Without doubt, this is reminding people that the population problem faced by China in the future is no longer only population increase.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	120020.000	120029.900				Based on the current fertility rate, China's population will start to experience negative growth in less than 20 years.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	120030.000	120039.900				What will be the extent of the negative growth?	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	120040.000	120049.900				If the fertility rate of 1.22 of China's population found out by the 2000 population census is accurate, even if we do not consider a possible further drop in fertility rate and simply go according to this figure, China's population by 2050 will even be at least 100 million lower than that of the forecasts of the United States and the United Nations.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	120050.000	120059.900				There is actually some clues now as to what new problems it will bring.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	120060.000	120069.900				For instance, since the year before last, many factories along the coast of Zhejiang and Guangdong no longer have enough laborers coming to apply for jobs. At first, it was thought that this phenomenon was only regional, but people only realized last year and this year that many places in China have this problem too.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	130010.000	130019.900				In the past twenty-plus years, China has always been worried about the overly fast population growth.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	130020.000	130029.900				However, in another about 20 years, China will experience a reverse trend of negative growth.	0	0	0		
GMW_CMN_20070107.0009	0	130030.000	130039.900				Facing such a situation, how should we reconsider China's population issue and current population policies?	0	0	0
