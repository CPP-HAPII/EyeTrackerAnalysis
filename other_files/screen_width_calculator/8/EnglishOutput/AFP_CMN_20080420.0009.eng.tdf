SYDNEY, 19th (AFP)A plan calling for cut ties between Australia and the British monarchy by 2010 won enthusiastic support today at an Australian summit of elite individuals from various sectors of society.More than a thousand representatives took part in the "2020 Summit" held in the capital Canberra.Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, after being elected last November and ending twelve years of Conservative Party rule, began preparations for the meeting that aims to call for a broad range of "big ideas".The delegates split into ten discussion groups, including one that discussed governance.That group of delegates overwhelmingly backed a proposal to end the ever-shrinking links to former colonial master Britain.It is these ties that mean Queen Elizabeth II remains Australia's monarch.The delegates initially proposed a 12-year time frame to make Australia a republic, but Home Affairs Minister Bob Debus's call for a much shorter deadline met with a positive response.Debus said, "I want us to say that we will proceed to a republic by 2010."A referendum on becoming a republic failed in 1999 after the then prime minister, Howard, strongly campaigned against the change.But Howard's successor Kevin Rudd has described himself as "lifelong Republican", and monarchists have accused the center-left leader of calling the summit with a hidden agenda aimed at promoting a republic.Rudd described the delegates at the two-day summit as Australia's "best and most far-sighted figures". On the first day of the summit, they discussed such subjects as tax reform and increasing the exercise level of Australians.
