We all don't think like that as a person included in the topic.Everybody has a lot of experience being an anchor, including Li Xiang, Xie Na, He Jiong, Wang Han. We all have our own stage. We are all number one brothers and number one sisters standing side by side."When the reporter mentioned that "A Date With Lu Yu" not only edged out "Evening" but also produced competition with the talk show hosted by Zhang Dandan "Stories from Behind the Scenes" and that a blog post published by Zhang Dandan titled "Lu Yu, Competitor or Friend?" created a stir, Lu Yu said: "There is friendly competition between Dandan and I, making the stage bigger. Together, both of us can grow."She said candidly that the two of them are good friends in their personal lives and they admire each other.As for the statement about competition existing between the two talk shows, Lu Yu didn't directly respond: "What we need to do is make interview shows a bit more lively. This is what the audience hopes to see."Although most of her time is still spent on anchoring, Lu Yu tries to dabble in other fields. After starting the digital magazine, she also plans to film a movie to expand her career and she said she wants to invite Jay Chou to act. (Huang Kang, Gao Lei)
