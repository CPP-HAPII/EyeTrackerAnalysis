Apr. 27, 2008According to a Central News Agency report, the Internal Administration Committee of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan has set the 30th for preliminary review of the draft revision of part of the provisions of the "Regulations on Relations Between the People's of the Taiwan Region and Mainland Region" pertaining to the exchange of renminbi. Currently, Chinese Kuomintang Party legislators Lu Shiow-Yen and Lee Jih-chu [...] the two versions.Lin Yi-Shih, KMT Central Policy Committee Chief Executive, said today that the preliminary review could be used as an opportunity for everybody to discuss the issue and look it over. He added that he hoped that in the future the legislative yuan KMT party caucus's edition could also be discussed at the same time.The edition drafted by Lu Shiow-Yen stipulates, "Before the signing of a bilateral currency settlement agreement, currency issued by the mainland could not used in Taiwan for buying and selling, exchange or other type of transactions.But financial institutions in the Taiwan region that have been authorized through consultation of the China Central Bank, with the Finance Supervisory Commission may, at a designated location, engage in trial exchange business of currency issued on the mainland."On the other hand, the draft edition by Lee Jih-chu stipulates that Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission of the Executive Yuan should consult with Taiwan's China Central Bank to stipulate procedures for authorizing currency issued on the mainland to enter Taiwan.Besides these provisions, other regulations stipulate that currency issued in the mainland will be administered in Taiwan using the relevant provisions of the Rules for Administering Foreign Currency.However, Lin Yi-Shih said recently that the KMT caucus in the Legislative Yuan and its think tank has already drawn up an amendment draft, and it clearly stipulates that until the two sides sign a settlement agreement or establish a settlement mechanism, the China Central Bank could consult with the Financial Supervisory Commission regarding a test run of a method. While in the short-term there is no way to establish a settlement mechanism, this would keep the exchange of the renminbi in Taiwan from being legally restricted.In an interview with reporters this morning, he said the caucus's draft would be scheduled by the procedural committee to enter the legislative yuan agenda on the 29th,and that it was too late for it to be reviewed on the 30th. However, he still hoped that in the future the three editions would be examined, and everybody could use the preliminary review to discuss and look over the provisions. (Gao Ta-lin)
