April 23, 2008 10:45 Source: Chinanews.comCommentChinanews.com, April 23 - The other day, a group of Mainland magnates visited and inspected Taiwan, arousing the interest of the Taiwanese media and public.An article in Taiwan's "United Daily News - Black & White Group" said, it's come full circle. The scene from 20 years ago, where the Mainland greeted Taiwanese businesspeople, has turned into important Taiwanese politicians sweeping the path to +receive Mainland magnates.Moreover, we see county commissioners and mayors competing to treat them, one briefing after another and the incessant "ka-cha ka-cha" of flash bulbs flashing.Besides the speechlessness of public society, it's unavoidable to have a feeling of "both anticipation and apprehension." After all, are these Mainland magnates coming to "flip buildings" or "invest in production"?This wave of Mainland magnates came suddenly, indeed causing a shock in people's eyes.Taiwanese people should get a pretty good first impression from seeing the composed manner of conversation of these male magnates as well as their wives' simple dress, modest posture and absence of visible flashy jewelry.In particular, on the first day, somebody from the group anonymously contributed 10 million New Taiwan Dollars for a nutritional lunches fund for poor children in Taiwan, adding a much-told story.The article said, cross-strait communication will be definitely expanded and deepened - most people only think about the flow of money but ignore the exchange between people.Actually, asking Mainland magnates how they spend money in Taiwan is not as good as asking Mainland magnates how they feel about Taiwan in their heart.The flow of money is secondary. The most important is exchange and agreement of the heart.The article points out that in the last 20 years, Taiwanese businesspeople have not only made money in the Mainland but have also made an important contribution to the initial steps for the people's livelihood and economy in the Mainland. The philanthropy work in the Mainland attended by kind-hearted Taiwanese people - such as Project Hope - is full of kindness and love, has left many impressive stories that deeply move people.Mainland schoolchildren accept Project Hope contributed by Taiwan and poor Taiwanese children accept the nutritional lunches contributed by the Mainland.This cannot be valued with money but should be measured using the heart.
