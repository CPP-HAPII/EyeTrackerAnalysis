Staff Commentator (Source: PLA Daily, Page 1, Time of Release: 2007-01-15 06:35)More than 2,000 years ago, thinker Chuang Tzu of the Spring and Autumn period wrote "Happy and Free Excursion," eulogizing the great ambition of the mythical "Kunpeng," which spread its wings and soared ninety thousand li into the sky.Today Li Zhonghua and the heroic air force flight testing group he represents are proving with their powerful and air-conquering heroic deeds that they are indeed the "Kunpeng" of our great times.In accelerating national defense modernization through positive and rapid development, in realizing the revival of the great Chinese nation, their great ambition to fly vigorously and boldly further commands our passionate praises and eulogies.When he flies, he soars through the sky.Li Zhonghua, an international test pilot and air force test flight expert, has been flying for 18 years in scientific research flight testing, a job full of unknowns and danger. He has test-flown 26 plane models of three types of planes, fighter planes, fighter bombers, and transport planes, and completed a series of major test flight missions for scientific research, making outstanding contributions to the modernization and development of national air defense and the air force.During this time, he has not only experienced countless dangers and difficulties, but even approached "death's door" several times, fearlessly defying the angel of death.As a result, when President Hu Jintao received Li Zhonghua, he assessed him highly: a new model of high-quality test pilots with a mastery of both thought and technique, a worthy and outstanding representative of our military's pilots.He mentioned: His adherence to the mission, his political consciousness of dedication to the nation, his aspiring spirit toward professional devotion and painstaking research, and his heroism in squarely facing dangers and bravely climbing to the highest points are worthy of study by the entire military.President Hu's important instruction profoundly unveiled the nature of Li Zhonghua's lofty spirit, while giving clear direction to military personnel to deeply undertake learning from Li Zhonghua.No achievement without ambition.Those who have seen Li Zhonghua's scientific research test flights are invariably profoundly impressed by his dangerous flight routes etched in the blue sky and moved by his selfless and fearless dedication.At the most basic, what has enabled Li Zhonghua to continue performing amazing feats on the test flight frontlines for the past 18 years is his high degree of political consciousness in adhering to the mission and dedication to the nation.It is precisely this political consciousness which has caused him to always place the interests of the nation and the people first. He resolutely entered the ranks of People's Air Force pilots upon graduation from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, becoming one of our military's first group of pilots with double bachelor's degrees. It is precisely this political consciousness which has caused him to disregard personal gains and losses and unhesitatingly enter the dangerous profession of scientific research flight testing. He has struggled tenaciously to change the backward situation of our national air defense scientific research and to accelerate modernization of the People's Air Force. It is also this political consciousness which has caused him to remain committed to his great ambition despite years of encountering dangers in the blue sky and even the threat of death. His aim has not wavered in the face of temptations from various materialistic gains in society.The military exists for missions. Soldiers are born to fight for victory, and carrying out missions is the sacred duty of every soldier.In learning from Li Zhonghua, the first thing is to learn his adherence to the mission and his political consciousness of dedication to the nation.As we enter a new century, even though peace and development are still the dominant current, the world is not at peace. Regional wars and conflicts are constantly arising, with conventional and unconventional security issues intertwined, causing our national security and development to face a host of complex problems, while national defense and construction of the military also face serious challenges.President Hu's proposal, concerning our military's historic mission for a new century and a new phase, has further expanded the functions of our military, making our military's mission even more formidable and glorious.From the elevated perspective of realizing our Party's three historic tasks and the great revival of the Chinese nation, all military personnel should recognize the great significance of carrying out our military's historic mission. Like Li Zhonghua, they should continue to reinforce their sense of mission, stand steadfast at their posts, complete unit construction and various preparations for military combat with a great sense of responsibility and urgency, and focus all willpower and strength on fulfilling the historic mission of our military in a new century and a new phase.In history, the fulfillment of any great and sacred mission has always required lofty and selfless dedication.The deeds of Li Zhonghua, along with numerous heroes and models emerging from a peaceful era, all fully attest to this point.As a soldier during the period of the rise of the Chinese nation, he will not only experience baptism by blood and fire and fierce life-threatening fighting when war breaks out and national security and unification are threatened, but will also face various dangers and tests at any time and place during normal times.This calls on every Chinese soldier to follow Li Zhonghua's example, giving priority to national defense and military construction, giving priority to the future of the nation and the people. Upon joining the People's Army, they should build up a selfless spirit ready to sacrifice themselves for the development of the country and the revival of the nation, on behalf of the Party and the people, and to fulfill the historic mission.Only when this kind of spirit has been established can they act like Li Zhonghua -- when encountering difficulties and dangers in national defense scientific research and military combat preparations, they will face danger unhesitatingly and resolutely; when sudden disasters and various dangerous and difficult tasks appear, they will bravely step forward and make vigorous fighting efforts against all odds; and when there is conflict between personal interests and interests of the Party and the people, they will sacrifice personal interests for the great cause.They can truly prove worthy of our military's sacred mission, living up to the great entrustment of the nation and the people.
