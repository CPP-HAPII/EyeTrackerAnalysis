Their extradition to Matzu was originally expected to occur at 9:30 this morning, but probably because of the maritime weather, their arrival in Matzu was delayed until 10:30.Criminal investigators expect that following the two individuals' arrival in Matzu, they will undergo preliminary depositions in Lienchiang County, before returning by air patrol helicopter to the "Criminal Investigation Bureau" in Taiwan.They are expected to arrive on Taiwan Island in the afternoon.It was learned that on January 2, 2007, a cash delivery vehicle robbery occurred in Taipei City. The criminal suspects robbed as much as NT$56 million (equivalent to 14 million yuan).Following investigation, Taiwan police authorities found that Lee Han-yang, a Group 4 Securicor cash delivery vehicle driver and security guard, was under serious suspicion of committing the crime.The same morning, this man escorted a vehicle carrying NT$79.2 million to the bank for deposit. On the way, he drugged security guard Lin Jung-ter on the same vehicle, then loaded NT$56 million onto a waiting car arranged in advance. He then immediately drove the car to Taoyuan International Airport. On the way he gave the money to a Taiwanese man, following which, this Lee took NT$200,000 and fled by boarding a plane to Hong Kong and sneaking into the mainland.On January 5, after mainland police authorities learned about this, they immediately deployed relevant local public security departments to search for the whereabouts of the criminal suspect, and made every effort to capture him.After careful investigation, Guangdong and Yunnan Province police agencies found that the day he fled to Hong Kong, the criminal suspect sneaked into Guangdong and joined his brother Lee Chin-tsan. On the 6th they traveled to Kunming, Yunnan, and hid themselves in a residential subdivision.At around 24:00 late night on the 9th, the Yunnan Province public security agency acted decisively and captured Lee Han-yang. His brother Lee Chin-tsan was also captured on suspicion of shielding and harboring a criminal.After interrogation, criminal suspect Lee Han-yang confessed completely to the drugging, and robbery of the cash delivery vehicle, the crimes that took place on January 2 in Taipei.Mainland police authorities will extradite criminal suspects Lee Han-yang and Lee Chin-tsan, in accordance with the "Kinmen Agreement" in the coming few days.
