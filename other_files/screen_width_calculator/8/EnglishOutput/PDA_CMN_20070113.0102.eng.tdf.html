January 13, 2007 12:50China News Agency, Taipei, January 12 (Correspondent Dong Huifeng) The Taipei District Court convened its fourth procedural hearing in preparing the "state affairs fund" case on the 12th.At the court, the prosecution and defense skirmished over two key points: one was whether it was okay to call for the medical records of Chen Shui-bian's wife, Wu Shu-chen; the second was whether the relevant documents were "top secret."With regard to Wu Shu-chen's failure to appear in court excusing herself for the third time, Chief Prosecutor Chang Hsi-huai asked the collegial bench to call for the National Taiwan University Hospital's consultation, medical and treatment records relating to Wu Shu-chen since July 1, 2006.The defense lawyer, Ku Li-hsiung, argued that if the collegial bench called for Wu Shu-chen's medical records and other materials, it would amount to an infringement of her right to individual privacy. If any risk to Wu Shu-chen was occasioned by her appearing in court, the presiding judge would be personally to blame.With respect to whether what Chen Shui-bian described in response to the prosecutor's inquiries as "classified files" were "top secret," Public Prosecutor Lin Ta quoted from three files, stating that they were not really "top secret," provoking the protests of the defense lawyers.Chang Hsi-huai maintained that in order to expedite the hearing of this case, in keeping with the principle of his two previous requests for securing complete evidence, he proposed that the Taipei District Court subpoena the current secretary-general of the "Presidential Office" as well as those who held the post over the past five years to give an explanation in court.After consideration by the collegiate bench, it was decided that when the next hearing is held next Friday (on the 19th), four people including the head of the second bureau of the "Presidential Office" would be subpoenaed to testify in court. A separate decision will be made later with respect to the secretary-general and other staff members.While the court hearing was in progress, several ordinary people went to protest outside the Taipei District Court.The investigation into the "state affairs fund" case was wrapped up on November 3 last year, with the prosecutors charging four people -- Wu Shu-chen, Ma Yung-cheng, Lin Te-hsun and Chen Chen-hui -- with corruption and the forgery of documents. On December 15, the Taipei District Court held its first hearing into this case.
