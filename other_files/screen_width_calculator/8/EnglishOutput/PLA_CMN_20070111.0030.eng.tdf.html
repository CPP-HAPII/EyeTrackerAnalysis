Zhou Dongmei, Li Guanghui, Contributing correspondent Tan Xiongying (Source: PLA Daily 1st edition, Dispatch time: January 11, 2007 06:37)At 10:20 a.m. on January 6, with the green signal flare shot up to the sky, six military helicopters of a Jinan military region aviation regiment zoomed to the sky accompanying the rumbling roar. They quickly completed the formation in the sky and leapt at the designated assault region, thus kicking off the coordinated drills with other arms of the services for the new year.At the control tower, groups of data continued to show on the screen of the automated flying drill command system and the commander then gave one order after another.Commissar Yang, commander of the flying drill, told me that the wind had reached fresh to strong breeze level today. With the hazy mist on the ground, the visibility was very low, thus posed tough challenges for the flying drill.However, the regiment did not cancel the flight due to the weather and conducted the coordinated land and air drill with a neighboring unit as scheduled.I ascended a military helicopter that was about to lift off before it started flight. The flight engineer was conducting various kinds of pre-flight apparatus inspectionPilot Wang Chunlin who was sitting at the pilot seat told me that even though the regiment strengthen the drill in highly difficult courses such as ultra-low flying, zoom-climb, and air-to-land assault, they were all gaming simulation of one arm of the services. Today was the first time they conducted coordinated drill with another unit.The signal flare shot up into the sky once I descended the plane.I saw one military helicopter leapt to the sky after another. They completed different flying formations in the sky and quickly disappeared from sight.At 13:10, Zhang Mousheng, the regimental commander who returned from the coordinated drill that he led, took off his helmet and told me, "Last year, while enhancing the drills in basic courses, the regiment also strengthened drills in courses including flight maneuvering and military tactics with emphases on nighttime distance transportation, rocket attacks, nighttime search and rescue, but they were all relatively simple gaming simulations of one arm of the services.In the new year, the regiment took the initiative in launching comprehensive coordinated drills with various arms of the services formed with another group army and completed drills in highly difficult courses that circumstances did not allow before and realized the transformation from single service and arms gaming simulation to various services and arms gaming with troops.At 14:47, with the smooth landing on the runway of the last group of helicopters taking part in the coordinated drill, the regiment's first coordinated drill in flight courses with other arms of the services of the new year all came to an end.(Staff Reporter, Zhengzhou, January 9)
