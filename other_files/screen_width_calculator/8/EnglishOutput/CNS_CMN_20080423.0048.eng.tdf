After a short appearance that afternoon in Philadelphia, he didn't wait for the election results before moving the fight to Indiana.Hillary on the other hand stayed in Philadelphia with her supporters to celebrate their victory together.Following the Pennsylvania election, the gap between Obama and Hillary's party delegate counts has not shrunk markedly.Prior to this contest, Obama led Hillary by about 140 delegates.Neither of the pair can win enough delegates to secure the nomination before the Democratic primaries in the various states end on June 3.Before June 3, the two will go on to hold primary contests in North Carolina, Indiana, Oregon, Kentucky, West Virginia, Montana, South Dakota, as well as Puerto Rico and the island of Guam.The US Democratic Party Convention will be held in Denver in August this year.On that occasion, almost 800 Democratic Party superdelegates will decide who will become the Democratic presidential candidate.
