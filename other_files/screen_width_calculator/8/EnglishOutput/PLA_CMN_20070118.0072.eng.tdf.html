In addition, they suited the remedy to the case and provided effective solutions to the issues. This was a good opportunity that was hard to come by.Not only did they need to be communicated to the letter, in-depth interpretation was also provided to all officers and men.Soon after, an unprecedented video and teleconference was held simultaneously at the college's main campus and its Shanghai regional campus.After communicating the assessment comments of the Military Academies Teaching Assessment expert team to the letter, the college's leaders provided personal instructions and interpreted the expert team's assessment comments to everyone one by one.In order to be well-prepared for this 'interpretation meeting', the college's leaders took the lead in learning and reached a consensus in ideological understanding.The college's Party Committee held special thematic working conferences and teaching situation analysis meetings to study assessment comments and rectification and reform measures.As to results, they were being practical, as for problems, they would not cover them up and be unreal about them.The college's Party committee conducted a comprehensive analysis on the assessment comments of the expert team and affirmed their own results in the college's operational ideas, distinctive characteristics in educating people, educational reforms, course setup, and school conditions. They also organized eight key items to summarize their work experiences including the college's engagement in building an educational system of the concept of scientific development, 'complete interactive teaching method' for in-service training, building of informatization of political work, and media background training.In the meantime, in relation to the three issues and suggestions put forward by the expert team, they developed them one by one and concluded them into 20 small items.They analyzed them one by one from major items involving ideas of running the school and building of the corps of teachers to minor items such as classroom discipline and cultivation of students' qualities.They conducted self-disclosure and looked for weaknesses especially in key problems including the gap between teaching and actual combat and the low-quality scenario military assignments and comprehensive drills.The 'pulse' was felt, how to prescribe the 'remedy'?How to do well in the second part of the teaching assessment?The college's Party committee reached a consensus: to turn assessment and evaluation results into long-term teaching mechanism!In order to achieve this, they enacted and issued the Implementation Suggestions on the Rectification, Reform, and Building Work Mentioned in the Teaching Assessment and held a college-wide educational mobilization meeting in rectification, reform, and building. They requested to consider rectification, reform, and building as key elements in the year-end review and made explicit demands in rectification, reform, and building work.The college leaders led a work team to go deep into the frontline of teaching and among the students to study the thinking of the officers and men and to organize the rectification and reform measures.Based on the research and study, the college Party committee confirmed to consider the heightening of the quality of classroom teaching the breakthrough point and point of penetration of the rectification and reform.In order to do this, they issued the Key Measures in the Immediate Heightening of Classroom Teaching Quality to conduct scientific analyses and standardizations in nine areas including improving classroom teaching quality standards, enacting complete teaching ombudsmen system, and innovating course examination formats.In the end of last December, the college held the 5th Party Congress.They considered the rectification, reform, and building work mentioned in the teaching assessment an important content of the meeting.
