(Source: Xinhua News Agency script Issue time: 2007-01-18 17:02)Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 18 - (Reporter Xiao Wenfeng) Guangzhou held a public hearing for the first time for a sentence commutation and parole case.If everything goes smoothly, 53-year-old Duan Li (alias) will obtain parole before this year's Spring Festival, after serving nearly 10 years in prison.According to the disclosure, this kind of system, with the purpose of eliminating the general public and relevant person's anxiety toward sentence commutation and parole cases, is expected to be implemented comprehensively in Guangzhou in the second half of this year.During the public hearing on the 17th, Duan Li's "prison mate" testified, bearing witness to her "good transformation" and her winning praises many times during the prison period.The prison guard of Guangdong Provincial Female Jailhouse, where Duan Li served her prison sentence, also put out material evidence, striving to obtain the parole opportunity for Duan Li in court.Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court Vice-President Huang Rongfu said after the public hearing that it can make sentence commutation and parole public and transparent, and is advantageous in further guaranteeing the judge's fairness and dispelling public misgivings.Huang Rongfu said that, for a long time, because the "Law of Criminal Procedure" had no explicit stipulations, plus the quantity of sentence commutation and parole cases was great and the legal trial periods were comparatively short for a long time; therefore, the court has usually adopted a method of trial by writing. This would easily cause people involved in the case and the general public to have doubts. For instance, some prisoners serving sentences, who didn't obtain the sentence commutation and parole, might suspect that there were "deals" involved in the trial process.Huang Rongfu also believed that if the trial process of sentence commutation and parole is not public and lacks transparency, it will indeed go against forming effective surveillance on judges.Guangzhou Intermediate Court Trial Surveillance Presiding Judge Deng Ganhua explained that according to the current tentative plans of Guangzhou Intermediate Court, all parole cases and sentence commutation cases involving more than two years will have a public hearing, and the audience scope will possibly be further expanded in the future. "For instance, the victims and family members of victims involved in violent crime cases, and the victimized units involved in economic crime cases, all will have the possibility of being brought into the participating witness scope in future practices."(End)
