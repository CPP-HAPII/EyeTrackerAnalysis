January 22, 2007 16:22At the national financial work conference held last week, Premier Wen Jiabao said that the tasks of financial reform and development for now and for some time in the future are very arduous and that it is necessary to make overall plans and take all factors into consideration with an emphasis on key points. In addition he listed six areas of work that will need to be carried out vigorously, including actively and steadily pushing for the opening-up of the financial sector to the outside world and "further advancing financial collaboration between the mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao."Those familiar with the situation know that the national financial work conference is not a regular annual meeting.It was only held twice in the past respectively in 1997 and in 2002, and each time it was held at the critical moment of economic and financial development concerning the major reform and deployment of the financial management system.After the conference held in 1997, the central finance authority issued 270 billion yuan in special treasury bonds through designated agencies to supplement the funds of four big state-owned banks; four major assets management companies were established; and Securities Regulatory Commission and Insurance Regulatory Commission were established.And after the conference held in 2002, a series of financial reform and development measures were introduced one after another, for example, Banking Regulatory Commission was established, China Central Huijin Investment Co., was founded, and China Construction Bank, Bank of China, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, among others, all went public in Hong Kong.Looking back on the history, it is not hard to see the special importance of the financial work conference.Therefore, it is exceptionally noticeable when financial collaboration with Hong Kong was publicly mentioned for the first time at this conference. People are looking forward to seeing what action will be taken next to implement the conference's requirement.In addition, adding RMB service in Hong Kong has been recently approved, and mainland financial institutions are permitted to issue financial bonds in RMB in Hong Kong. The SAR government has also put forward several financial collaboration proposals in the guidelines of the Summit on "the Eleventh Five-Year Plan and Hong Kong Economy." It can be said that many actions have been taken, promising a huge potential imaginable for the prospect of financial collaboration between the two localities.No wonder Hong Kong Financial Secretary Henry Tang expressed welcome to this on behalf of the SAR right upon learning the relevant information.Just as Financial Secretary Tang said, this is the first time that the national financial work conference considered how to utilize the financial collaboration with Hong Kong to advance the opening-up of the country's financial sector and capital market to the outside world when formulating the national financial policy.He said that the SAR government and the financial community will surely continue to exploit Hong Kong's special advantages, fully support the national economic development strategies and make greater contributions to the country's comprehensive deepening of financial reform and promotion of the sustainable, healthy and safe development of the financial sector.If in the past some people in Hong Kong might have the biased idea such as the so-called large one-way "gift-giving" with respect to the financial cooperative relationship between the two localities, now they are considering this issue more from the perspective of mutual benefit.In addition, the SAR government has recently proposed that "three interactive" relations, namely, "complementing each other, helping each other and interacting with each other," should be established between the financial systems in the mainland and Hong Kong under the framework of "one country, two systems."It is believed that with the change of the perspective in thinking, the financial collaboration between the two localities will enjoy greater room and smoother progress.(Source: Hong Kong Commercial Daily, Abridged, Writer: Long Dongzhi)
