Lula thinks the government should not turn a blind eye to this.He said: "Faced with these indebted clubs, how can the government not bail them out?These clubs are not some companies, but are teams that stir the hearts of millions of people. They are a part of Brazil's culture."At the same time, Lula expressed regret at the talented young players leaving domestic clubs one after another to go to Europe in search of money.He believes that an environment should be created which can retain these players.He said: "As a soccer fan, I feel saddened that our clubs have been unable to keep hold of these players."Lula stressed: "In Brazil there are three things that bring rich people and poor people, black people and white people together: carnival, the beach and soccer.It is soccer that lets many young people find themselves again.Soccer is a national passion. It is completely a part of our daily life."He said: "Many people think that the job of the president is to sign some statutes.That's wrong. The president's job is to tell everyone: I'm the same as you. I have feelings, too. When the club I like loses, I feel bad as well."It is reported that Lula attended an awards ceremony given for former national team soccer player Roberto Rivelino on the evening of the 29th.He made the speech above at this ceremony.(End)
