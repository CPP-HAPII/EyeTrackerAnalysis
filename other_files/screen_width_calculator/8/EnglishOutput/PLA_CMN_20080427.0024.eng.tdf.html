This ceaselessly brings out and enriches Communist Youth League's style and content of activities and arouses the enthusiasm of young soldiers to get involved in military battle preparation.They often launch "golden idea" and "good creativity" recruitment activities in the Youth League.In the past few years, officers and soldiers designed and recommended a total of 8 types and 127 activities for all levels of regiment organizations, including sports, arts & literature and intelligence boosting activities.Currently, of all the brigade's widely launched Communist Youth League activities, 30 were deeply welcomed by everybody including "youth beat" and "mine field crossing." All of the activities were collected from front line Youth League members.Targeting the reality of the troops' long training time on the river, the importance of emergency flood fighting missions and the high number of urgent, hard, dangerous and important missions, this division's Youth League committee emphasizes using missions to guide activities. They use activities to promote the completion of the missions.For example, they combine outdoor training, practice drills, flood fighting and other important missions to guide regiment organizations of battalion and company to take actions that suit real circumstances. The organizations then develop beach races, beach volleyball, singing in the water, sunshine partners and other activities that both enrich officers and soldiers' cultural life and foster their team spirit.
