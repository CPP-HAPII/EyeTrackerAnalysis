Teheran (AFP), 6th.OPEC Secretary General, Badri rejected the calls for an increase in output by oil-consuming countries. He said that non-fundamental factors are the primary cause of the current increase in oil prices.Yesterday evening, Badri arrived in Iran for a three-day visit.He said: "The current supply of oil in the market is ample. There is no need to change the output of OPEC."According to Iran's state-run television station, he pointed out " the U.S.'s economic recession, lack of refining capacity and depreciation of the U.S. dollar" are the main causes of the record high oil prices.On the weakness of the USD, tight energy supplies and more bad news about the U.S. economy, oil prices surpassed 106 USD per barrel on the New York Stock Exchange on the 4th of this month.At a press conference held together with Iranian oil minister Nozari, Badri said: "The world's current oil reserves are enough for 53 days. This shows the market is not short of oil."Last month, OPEC said OPEC's basket price of oil broke the 100-USD mark for the first time.However, Iran strongly supports not changing the current production limit.Iran is OPEC's second largest oil country ((pw)).Nozari said: "With the price of oil at 100 USD per barrel, OPEC's production won't be increased or decreased."Badri said: "Nobody can pressure OPEC because we make decisions based on our own interests."Nozari also said that it would be "impossible" to hold a special meeting before the next OPEC meeting scheduled to be held in September.
