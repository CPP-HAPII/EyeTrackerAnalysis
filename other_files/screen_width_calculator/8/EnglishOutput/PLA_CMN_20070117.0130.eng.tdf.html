(Source: Xinhua News Agency script Issue time: 2007-01-17 17:19)Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 17 - (reporter Zhang Yong, Chen Binhua) The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council spokesperson Yang Yi on the 17th said at the routine press conference that in 2006, personal interactions and various exchanges between both sides of the Taiwan Strait have continued to maintain good development status.The number of Taiwan residents visiting the Mainland during the year is estimated to have broken through 4,400,000 person-times, whereas the number of Mainland residents visiting Taiwan during the year is estimated to have passed 200,000 person-times.Yang Yi said that, in 2006, various exchanges between both sides of the Taiwan Strait have deepened in all aspects, with cultural exchange being the highlight.Large quantities of outstanding traditional theater plays, contemporary arts, cultural relics, as well as literary projects rich in regional characteristics, entered the island for exchange and were well received.A group of brand projects of exchange between both sides emerged, such as "China and Taiwan Youth Forum," "Northern Winter Camp for Both Sides across the Taiwan Strait," "Grand Joint Mid-Autumn Celebration of Various Nationalities from Both Sides across the Taiwan Strait," and so on.Yang Yi said that during the year, we earnestly implemented practical measures to fulfill various pledges the motherland Mainland has made to Taiwan compatriots, diligently created a good environment for Taiwan compatriots' study, and work and life in the Mainland.Regarding Taiwanese compatriot school admissions, we formally approved Taiwanese university and college records officially certified by Taiwanese education authorities.Regarding Taiwanese compatriot employment, we opened the qualification examinations for customs officials and registered architects to Taiwan residents.Regarding Taiwanese compatriot medical care, we put out a series of measures which would accommodate Taiwanese compatriot medical care and facilitate medical service exchange and cooperation between both sides, and actively put into practice the relevant memorandum agreed to by the Ministry of Health and the Secretariat of the WHO in 2005, making it possible for the medical experts from both sides to participate in the WHO's related technological activities.Regarding Taiwanese compatriot entry and exit of the Mainland, we added Shenyang, Dalian and Chengdu, these three port cities where Taiwanese compatriots can land and obtain arrival visas.The above policies have been highly appraised by Taiwanese compatriots.Yang Yi said that last year we continued to put into effect the consensus with the Kuomintang, and the People First Party persevered in promoting the travel activities of Mainland residents visiting their relatives in Taiwan, and the work of presenting a panda to Taiwan as a gift.Through diligence and hard work, substantive progress has been made in the work regarding Mainland residents going to visit Taiwan. There have already been three rounds of consultations between civil organizations of both sides of the Taiwan Strait.Although as a result of Taiwanese authorities' obstruction, the general public of Taiwanese compatriots is still unable to witness the panda's elegant demeanors from nearby, we didn't stop our work in promoting this.We hope the two lovely pandas, "Tuan Tuan" and "Yuan Yuan," can go to Taiwan as soon as possible.He indicated that in the new year, we will be promoting exchanges and communications of both sides as always, and will continue to work diligently for the peaceful and stable development of relations between both sides of the Taiwan Strait.We also hope that Taiwan authorities will lift their limitations concerning exchange of both sides, and practically respond to general Taiwanese compatriots' expectation of peaceful development of both sides.When talking about issues concerning Taiwanese reporters coming to the Mainland for press interviews, Yang Yi said that not long ago, for Taiwanese reporters to come to the Mainland for press interviews, they needed to apply to the public information agencies or local Taiwan affairs offices of the State Council beforehand. After obtaining approval, they used the Taiwan reporter interview approval notice to go through the entry procedures.But according to the newly promulgated "Regulations of Taiwanese Reporter Interviewing in Motherland Mainland during Beijing Olympic Games and its Preparation Period," a Taiwanese reporter coming to the Mainland for press interviews now only needs to get the interview unit or individual's approvals.Therefore before going for a visa, Taiwanese reporters should contact and make arrangements with interview units or individuals beforehand, and this will be used as evidence when the visa issuing unit issues a visa.In addition, the "Organizations with delegated authorities from the managing institution" referred to in the "Regulations of Taiwanese Reporter Interviewing in Motherland Mainland during Beijing Olympic Games and its Preparation Period" mean the Hong Kong China Travel Service, Macao China Travel Service and related units will handle visa issues of Taiwan residents coming to the Mainland.(end)
