American researchers developed a new technique to successfully activate some specific genes in cultivated cells in the laboratory.Researchers said that it is hopeful to use this result to find new treatment for certain diseases.Gene is a segment on the chromosome that carries the genetic information.The special auxiliary protein molecular group surrounding the chromosomal DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) has a very delicately balanced layout structure. They are the 'switches' of genes responsible for transcribing the 'coded protein' emitted by the genes to the messenger RNAs (ribonucleic acid).The messenger RNAs then enter the 'protein factory' (ribosome) in the cells to take part in the forming of various proteins that perform different bodily functions.Pharmacologist Bethany Janowski at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in the United States and other people reported in the online edition of the Nature Chemical Biology on the 28th that they used specially created antigen RNAs to 'repair' the protein group of a specific gene in the cultivated mammalian cancer cells. They eventually succeeded in activating this gene and controlling the growth speed of the cancer cells.The report showed that the abovementioned RNA molecule can 'nudge' this auxiliary protein group like an elbow to 'awaken' the gene expression.Researchers said that this new technique of using RNA to 'turn on' specific genes is the most effective and reliable gene activation technique to date.Not only will this technique help develop new gene therapies that cure diseases, it will also provide a new tool to researchers to conduct in-depth research in the roles played by genes in human bodies.Researchers stated that specific gene expressions in some patients are not completely turned off, only that the expression levels are lower than normal, thus causing inadequate amount of particular protein in the body.Therefore, if the gene expression level can be brought up with the new technique, then it will greatly improve the effectiveness of treatment or even find a cure to the diseases.
