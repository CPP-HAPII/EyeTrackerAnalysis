Xu Fangyong, Jiang Li (Source: PLA Daily Page 3 Issue time: 2007-01-25 06:31)Nanjing Military Area Command coastal defense Brigade Commissar Chen Junming is an outstanding national party affairs worker.Those familiar with him all say that his manner is open and straightforward, and not only does he have the integrity to dare to confront hard situations, but also has the rigorous attitude of daring to be earnest.Political cadres must understand military affairsTwo years ago, political cadres' lack of military skills was once considered "normal shortcomings" in the coastal defense Brigade.Some political cadres could only "shout till the voice is broken" in the training ground, yet were unable to actually "show an example."Regarding this, some people became accustomed to it, yet it was intolerable to the newly appointed Brigade Commissar Chen Junming: A political cadre should first be a qualified serviceman; how can he lead troops to win a battle without understanding military affairs?He suggested to the Brigade party committee and the political department that, for those political cadres whose military skills do not stand up to the most rigorous test, they cannot be appraised as advanced performers; also they cannot be promoted.Chen Junming led by example. He used the opportunity of going down to the basic unit for practice, he took up his old specialty of the artillery again, and competed with the officers and soldiers on the same levels and won wide plaudits from the officers and soldiers by his deftly "unique skills."He also explored new tactical rules and new training methods together with the officers and soldiers, dabbled in specialties such as anti-aircraft artillery and infantry, unceasingly widening his military knowledge.In order to institutionalize and regulate political cadre military study, Chen Junming suggested that the party committee should analyze the case and make a decision to make every Thursday a day of political cadre military studies.Political cadres should participate in military competitions, step onto the training ground, practice weapon operation together with military cadres, and practice leading skills.After one year, the military quality of political cadres of this Brigade have advanced remarkably.Under the leadership of Chen Junming, every standing member of this Brigade's party committee knows how to use the primary military equipment. A "standing committee double artillery class" with regular training was established, the members of which can operate both anti-aircraft guns and artillery.When certain new equipment was just allocated to the army, "the standing committee class" and "the new equipment development group" then trained and studied together.After three months, during the practical shooting practice of the new equipment, "the standing committee class" first went on stage and achieved a "grand opening" score.Chen Junming made it a hobby of studying modern military command skill and exploring military high-tech knowledge, persisted every day in studying modern military theory, and wrote down various reading notes reaching around 100,000 characters.Some people urged Chen Junming, as a political cadre, not to neglect his own land while planting in another's field.He said with a smile: "In my responsible plot, there's no 'private plot'; whichever field is not cultivated well, I will have responsibilities which cannot be shirked."At the beginning of last June, the military region inspection group carried out an inspection on the Brigade commanding staff's abilities in leading comprehensive training exercises of all aspects.Before the inspection, it happened that the brigade commander was away for study.Facing the various "enemy intelligence" put forward by the inspection group, Chen Junming responded calmly. During the three-((pw)) and three-night-long training exercise inspection, by reason of military command skills which stand up to the most rigorous test, he finished the task splendidly.Say no to extra housing occupants who "stubbornly resist moving""Cleaning up extra housing occupants" is an issue some leaders feel is quite thorny and difficult.Chen Junming said: "The difficulty lies in making the choice of whom you are responsible for, whose benefit you should place in the first place." While saying this, he has already made his own choice in his mind.The coastal defense Brigade had six sets of houses which were occupied by cadres who had left the Brigade for a long time. The several previous leaderships had diligently tried to solve the problem, yet no result had eventually come out.Chen Junming investigated and discovered that these six housing occupants all had some kind of relationship with various military leaderships.It was not that they didn't have houses to live in, it was only that they were all comparing with each other, and all used one so-called "person who stubbornly resists moving," who claimed to have a relationship with higher authorities as a shield.Chen Junming was determined to confront this obstacle.He decided to call the higher authority with whom "the person who stubbornly resists moving" claimed to have a relationship, and before he could make the call, "the persons who stubbornly resist moving" saw the earnestness of Chen Junming and returned the houses on their own.Party committee decision-making should not be led by the nose by business departmentsAt the beginning of Chen Junming's appointment, the newly organized leadership group held its first party committee meeting concerning the issues of barracks rebuilding.In the meeting, Chen Junming discovered that the discussions of some members were mostly "scratching itches through a boot," without hitting the point.The reason that the members could only make discussions "based on the topics" was that the topics were announced right before the meeting; therefore, no one had enough time to ponder over it thoroughly.According to the stipulations in "The CPC Army Committee Work Rules (Implementation)," the time and subject of a standing committee conference generally must be informed two days in advance.Chen Junming suggested that the study of the barracks rebuilding issues be postponed.Although in the second conference, the standing committee members all elaborated their own opinions concerning barracks rebuilding, yet these opinions were all from the perspective of the business affairs department's report, and only speaking of the accuracy and scientific nature without rational analysis as to its deficiencies and flaws."A party committee might be making biased decisions if the subject of the decision is without any opposing views," Chen Junming said. The mistakes caused by one-sided rational thinking could be even more serious.Chen Junming suggested once more that another meeting should be held, especially regarding the deficiency of the barracks rebuilding plan.During those days, Chen Junming and other standing committee members solicited opinions from local and military experts in every way, and researched large amounts of relevant information.Finally in the standing committee meeting, members proposed questions to the plan from twenty-two aspects such as building materials, barracks structural frames, room layout, and so on.After a thorough analysis of merits and demerits of the subject, the correct scientific plan emerged.One subject matter, three conferences.It was precisely during the process of repeated party committee "group" deliberations on the subject matter that they felt the heavy responsibilities on their shoulders and realized that the party committee group's scientific decision-making ability has great significance to organization construction.Taking this as an example, Chen Junming established three rules with the newly organized group members: The study of major issues must be carried out according to the party committee procedural rules; the assignment of major works must be decided collectively by the party committee, no one in charge can make the decision at will; in studying significant projects, if there are no opposite opinions as a reference, the party committee does not make the decision.For two years, the Brigade party committee has made around 20 major decisions, promoted about 110 cadres, selected approximately 165 soldiers for technology studies, all with the general approval of officials and soldiers.The coastal defense Brigade was appraised successively by the military region as "the advanced Brigade party committee" and "first-level military training unit."Chen Junming was also appraised as "the advanced brigade commanding officer" and "the nationally recognized outstanding party affairs worker."
