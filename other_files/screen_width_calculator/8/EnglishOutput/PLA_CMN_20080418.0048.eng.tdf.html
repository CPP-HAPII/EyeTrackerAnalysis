If a prescribed medicine is unsuitable, it will be promptly detected by the computer program and fed back through the network to the clinic to be handled as a rejected prescription, after which the prescribing physician will make corrections and issue a new prescription.Secondly, it will effectively monitor and control the implementation of prescriptions.After a compliant prescription is transferred to the pharmaceutical allocation center, each procedure will be verified by a pharmacist. Through confirmation by digital scanning, it is possible to inquire at any time into the status of drug dispensing, allocation and other processes, so as to ensure that there is no error with medicines.According to statistics, since the new clinical drug management method has been implemented, there has only been one case of a patient suffering a transfusion reaction following intravenous injection of drugs, meaning that transfusion reactions were only 1/10th of what they were during the same period the year before.Third, it guarantees that patients correctly take orally administered medicine.The pharmacist implements single-dosage allocation of patient daily dosages. These are collected by a nurse according to schedule and distributed to the patient, avoiding such phenomena as wastage due to the issue of a complete supply and patients missing a dose or incorrectly taking medicine.
