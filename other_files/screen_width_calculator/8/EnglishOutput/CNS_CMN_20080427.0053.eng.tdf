After that, they scattered to stand in different places and raised their heads to look for movement in the starry sky.Three minutes later, a bright scattered beam suddenly appeared in the sky and slid from the top of one horizon to another horizon."That's it, that's it, Tianlian I satellite..." shouted the command people that were standing in different positions and the crowd spread on the nearby hillside.Two minutes later, a bright line slid forwards. The scattered beam disappeared soon after and then just the electric-light-shaped light slowly slid towards the other side of the mountain.There were two great "rumble, rumble" sounds and the firelight turned half the sky red as the rocket booster wreckage touched down."The wreckage touchdown point is definitely not far. It's definitely in Jiucang district," judged Liang Jianlin, the vice-commander of this command operation and the head of the Renhuai human resources department."When the booster rocket wreckage touched down there was an extremely loud sound and the flaming firelight was extremely dazzling.After awhile we could smell a pungent odor," observer Wang Shihua said while being interviewed by a reporter 200 meters in diameter away from the wreckage crash area. The rocket booster wreckage touchdown time was 23:43.[1] --[2] --[Next Page] --
