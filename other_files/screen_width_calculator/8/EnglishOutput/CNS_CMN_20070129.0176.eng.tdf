January 29, 2007, 19:51The PLA will focus on the construction of army modernization and the preparation for military wars in reinforcing supervision and restriction on the use of authority.In the Plenary Session of the Leading Group for the Work on Auditing Economic Responsibility of the Army's Leading Cadres that was held on the 29th in Beijing, it was revealed that in 2007 the economic responsibility audit on the army's leading cadres will focus on department heads and leading cadres who are in charge of special mission departments for preparation of military wars. For the audit of leading cadres at division, brigade, and regiment levels, the ratio of department heads is not lower than 30%.General Liao Xilong, member of the Central Military Commission, director of the Leading Group for the Work on Auditing Economic Responsibility of the Army's Leading Cadres, and director of the General Logistics Department, pointed out at the session that comprehensive supervision will be applied on the investment orientation, investment amount, planning, execution, and utilization effects of the military wars preparation funds. Problems discovered will be rectified immediately to ensure all war constructions can withstand the tests of wars and history. Supervision and inspection on the economic decision-making authority, expense approval authority, and fund utilization authority of leading cadres will be reinforced by carrying out serious investigation and prosecution on people and things that are against laws and disciplines, and by constantly promoting the development of a work style for the team of leading cadres. Focusing on problems such as insufficient support, insufficient linkages, non-implementation, and non-standardization of the operations of the military economic reform policies and systems, analysis and research will be strengthened to propose countermeasure suggestions and promote a healthy development of the reform. The management ability and level of all levels of leaders must be constantly improved and the establishment and perfection of the long-term mechanism for scientific management must be promoted to truly find a way to construct army modernization more effectively and with fewer investments.In 2006, the PLA audited a total of 1,938 leading cadres above the regiment level. This played an important role in reinforcing cadre management, standardizing the economic order of the army, increasing the economic efficiency of the army, and promoting the cultivation of the party's work style and construction of a clean and honest administration.Source: Xinhuanet
