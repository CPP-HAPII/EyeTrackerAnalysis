The Higher Court formed a collegiate bench according to the law and heard the opinion of the defense. It recently made a final decision: appeal overruled, original judgment upheld.Xu Minchao's defense lawyer believes that Xu Minchao's conduct violated other people's bodily health, which met the requirements to constitute an intentional injury crime.Although he injured many innocent victims, he only used a knife, so the societal harm is limited. This is not sufficient to be put on par with arson, flooding and bombing. Therefore, it does not constitute intentional injury.The provincial Higher People's Court thinks that Xu Minchao's action of holding a knife at a tourist attraction where many people were gathered, harmed the personal bodily safety of an undesignated amount of people, resulted in injuries to 20 tourists and pedestrians and harmed public security. This is obviously different from harming a designated target, so it doesn't constitute intentional injury.Therefore, the provincial Higher People's Court thinks the original penalty given to Xu Minchao according to laws isn't inappropriate.The original conviction was accurate, the penalty was fit and the trial process was legal according to the relevant terms of our country's criminal procedure law. The appeal was overturned and the original judgment upheld, making it the final ruling.(Reporter Wang Fa)
