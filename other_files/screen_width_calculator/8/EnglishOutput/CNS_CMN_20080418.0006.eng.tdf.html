Average prices went down 3.4% compared to the last quarter, reaching 29,200 RMB per square meter.But the situation of house purchasers waiting to see didn't change much.In March, there were some improvements in the turnover situation in Beijing's residential sales, but it is still at a relatively low level compared to last year.CBRE said that due to the continuing wait-and-see mood of home purchasers in the Beijing market and the many domestic developers that have shelved their debt issuance or IPO plans in Hong Kong or the mainland A stock market has made the cash flow of many domestic developers extremely tight.Facing tightening monetary policies and complex economic circumstances, developers must speed up housing sales in order to maintain the cash flow that the business needs.Thus, discount sales promotion is extremely widespread in the market.CBRE said that facing a cooling of the stock market and housing market at the same time, many developers cannot help but adopt a cooperative or stock selling model in response to the crisis. Some real estate developing businesses are facing the risk for existence - the acquisition and merger activities of real estate businesses are continuously strengthening.Due to tightness in the funding chain for developers, the expansion speed of many developers is now clearly slowing down. They have been more cautiously buying land as well. (End)
