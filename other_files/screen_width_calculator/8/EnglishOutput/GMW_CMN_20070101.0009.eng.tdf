Zheng Hangen (Beijing editor) January 1, 2007It is another Christmas.In recent years, the Christmas atmosphere in Chinese cities is getting stronger.Many people have expressed their worries, and some doctoral students in some universities jointly boycotted Christmas, being afraid that Chinese people will have been completely Westernized.However, this writer believes that if we look at the historical evolution of Chinese culture, we will know that there is no need to have so much dislike for Christmas.Taking a broad overview of the long history of China, how many foreign cultures were there that entered?What happened in the end has been basically the blending of foreign cultures with the Chinese culture (mainly referring to the Central Plains culture). +In its blending and interacting with foreign cultures, not only has the Chinese culture not lost its own spirit and connotation, it instead shows more vitality due to tolerance and acceptance.If we appear flustered in the face of the currently popular Christmas and want to turn it away before we can feel safe, we, then, have not seen the tolerance and vitality in the spirit of the Chinese culture.Let's first take a look at the Chinese nation itself.To a very large extent, the history of the Chinese nation is a history of fusion between peoples.In history, what a great many strong borderland ethnic minorities who, in the beginning, all rejected Central Plains culture. In the end, however, they lived in harmony with the Central Plains culture and were even willing to learn and accept the Central Plains culture, finally becoming a part of the Chinese culture.What is most worth mentioning is the cultural ferment of India's Buddhism and Chinese culture.Buddhism was disseminated into China since the Western Han Dynasty. It mixed deeply with the Chinese culture and blended completely into the Chinese cultural system which created the Chan Sect, a pure Chinese Buddhist sect.Buddhism has a far-reaching influence on the culture and society of China, but not only did it not let the Chinese people get lost in the knowledge of the "Tatar," it instead let the Chinese culture appear more profound, brilliant, and sagacious in the process of assimilation and drawing on experience.Since around the Ming Dynasty, Western missionaries kept coming to the East to preach.The Chinese culture, however, has not lost itself because of this.What is worth mentioning is that in those years, many Jesuits who came to China to preach were, instead, touched by the spirit of the Chinese culture, and introduced Chinese philosophy to Europe secretly, leading to a Chinese cultural fever in Europe 200 years before.A confident and tolerant person will discover that the more he contacts with the outside world, the broader his wisdom and vision will be.A confident nation also will definitely not be scared of foreign cultures.Looking at the development of history, the Chinese culture possesses these characteristics of confidence and tolerance, and it creates newness in the midst of tolerance and acceptance.Looking at either in ancient times or today, either China or other lands, the vitality exists only in such cultures that are tolerant.The prosperity of the Tang Dynasty was attributed not only to its taking over the age-old inheritance of the Central Plains culture of three generations, but, all the more, to its assimilating the cultures of surrounding ethnic minorities and even foreign countries.A very important reason why the United States today can prosper is its spirit of cultural tolerance.In the United States, any culture can exist, hence bringing out a unique vitality.On the other hand, although Europe has a deeper cultural background compared to the United States, it seems a bit conservative and complacent.We do not need to dislike Christmas trees so much and be unhappy with the Christmas greetings that are going around everywhere these few days.A lively appearance does not mean that the connotation of the culture has been alienated.Facing the strong cultures from the West, what we probably need more is to reflect: Chinese cultural background has been confident, but are we today also fully confident because we really understand our own culture?
