China only started in 1949."Rogge said, "We abandoned colonial rule only 40 years ago. Let's be a little bit more modest."Rogge said, "We have the obligation to give China more time, and the Olympics will have a positive social influence on China."And personally, Rogge said, he himself has a very good relationship with Beijing authorities.
