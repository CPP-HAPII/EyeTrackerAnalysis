January 10, 2007 10:56Suppliers usually offer 25%-30% of the total sales to stores as discount points, and if consumers participating in stores' "rebate promotion" have purchased any goods with coupons, the stores will again get discount points.China News Service, Photo by Wu MangziDespite widespread complaints, why are so many stores still greatly interested in "rebate promotion?"It turns out that the stores can benefit from both sides this way.Yesterday, Xicheng formally ordered stores to stop charging suppliers arbitrary fees, or they will receive a penalty up to 30,000 yuan.Looking at the current situation, retailers, that is, stores, usually charge suppliers a variety of fees such as promotion fee, advertising fee, bar code fee, outfit fee, management fee, personnel service fee, and premium shelf fee, among which the promotion fee gives rise to the most prominent conflict. "If such fees are not allowed, these activities will not be carried out," said a relevant authority from the Economic Inspection Division of Xicheng Branch Administration of Industry and Commerce. This measure aims to change the extremely unfair positions of retailers and suppliers so as to fundamentally reduce the "rebate promotion" activities that the stores are crazy about.This responsible person said that at present large stores in Xicheng District have all adopted the operation mode of "attracting manufacturers to enter the store." Usually suppliers will have to offer 25%-30% of the total sales to stores as discount points, and if consumers participating in stores' "rebate promotion" have purchased any goods with coupons, stores will again get discount points."This has reduced suppliers' profits.As their profits are reduced, suppliers will try to get back the profits subtracted by stores by means of inflating the prices.In fact, the part subtracted by stores is ultimately absorbed by consumers, so it is obvious that consumers actually will not get any real benefit in the promotion activities.""Under such situation, suppliers have no choice but to participate in the promotion." The responsible person said that suppliers and retailers are in extremely unfair positions. If suppliers do not participate in the promotion, they are not even eligible to gain entry into the stores."Therefore, among the various fees stores charge suppliers, the promotion fee must be banned."It was disclosed that Xicheng Branch Administration of Industry and Commerce will next sample joint operation contracts in large stores within its jurisdiction. It is estimated that that 20 contracts per store will be sampled to check if the stores have violated any rules while entering into contracts with their suppliers.If any violation is found, the store will face a penalty up to 30,000 yuan.This responsible person also disclosed that Xicheng made this move to implement "Administrative Measures on Fair Transactions Between Retailers and Suppliers" established by the State Administration of Industry and Commerce. "This method is supposed to achieve a good result after implementation; however, as it is relatively foresighted, the experiment is conducted in Xicheng according to the deployment of the Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce. Once it proves successful, it will be implemented throughout the city."More than ten famous stores such as Zhongyou Department Store, Juntai Department Store, Xidan Market, Fuxing Commercial City, Chang An Store and Parkson are concentrated within the jurisdiction of Xicheng Branch Administration of Industry and Commerce.Reporters learned that at the seminar held yesterday in this regard, some people said right on the spot that they "can't do it this way."A relevant official from Xicheng Branch Administration of Industry and Commerce told reporters that the stores have a strong reaction against such action.This person said that the this move ultimately aims to reduce rebate promotion activities through coercive policy.(Source of Article: Beijing Daily Messenger, Writer: Ge Jisheng)
