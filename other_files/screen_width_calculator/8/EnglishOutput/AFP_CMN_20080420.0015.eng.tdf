Shannon, Ireland (AFP), 20th.US Secretary of State Rice stated today that although the Shia-lead Iraq government is severely punishing Shia militias and improving the security situation, she calls on Sunni Arab countries to uphold their "obligations to neighboring Iraq."Today, flying en route to Bahrain and Kuwait, Rice said: "To speak fairly, I think Iraq's neighboring countries can do more to fulfill their obligations, because I really think Iraq has already started to fulfill their obligations."Rice will hold meetings with foreign affairs ministers of Arabian countries in the Middle East.Rice said that Iraq's security has already made improvements; Shia Arab leadership is trying their best to protect the country, not the interests of their own sect.She called on Sunni Arab leaders to let diplomats return to Baghdad and forgive some of Iraq's foreign debt load.Since the US started the Iraq war in 2003 and overthrew the Sunni leader, Hussein, Arab countries have not only worried about Iraq's turmoil but have also worried that the supported Iraqi government will side with the Persian-organized Shia Islamic Republic of Iran.However, before Rice's private plane landed in Shannon, Ireland to fuel up, she said, the Iraq security situation has already improved, prime minister Maliki acted upon appeals to reconcile Iraq's Sunni and Shia Arabs with the Kurds.
