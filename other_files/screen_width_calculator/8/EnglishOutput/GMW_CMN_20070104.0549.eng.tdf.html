Wei Hao, Zhou Meng, 2007-01-04Gmw.cn, January 1, 2007 - According to information from the Control Center of the Henan Tongxu County Power Supply Bureau, the power supply of the bureau in 2006 set the highest record in history at 227.6 million kilowatt-hours.Tongxu County is a major agricultural county and has a weak industrial foundation. Prior to 2004, its power supply had always hovered around 110 million kilowatt-hours.In 2005, the leadership, with Niu Xing as its director, adjusted their work mindsets. Instead of sitting around waiting for customers, they had taken the initiative to launch actions, and instead of letting customers request for services, they had taken initiative to provide home services.They had adopted the "Five Industries" and focused on development promotion measures. They had also opened up marketing avenues and created new electricity growth points, and this had in turn led to a relatively big breakthrough in power supply.By the end of 2006, the power supply for the year was over 32 million kilowatt-hours higher than that in 2005, and twice that in 2004.
