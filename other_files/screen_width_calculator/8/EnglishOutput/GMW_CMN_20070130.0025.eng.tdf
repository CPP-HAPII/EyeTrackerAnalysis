Shen Yangyou, January 30, 2007Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference Wang Yushi submitted a proposal to the Fifth Session of the Ninth Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference suggesting that supervision of golf club members among civil servants should be stepped up in order to fight corruption and promote a clean government.He argued that for ordinary salaried workers, playing golf is something that they dare not dream of because it is an extravagant sport for the moneybags. Ordinary people simply cannot afford the high cost.Let's take the membership card that a Nanjing golf club introduces as an example. The least expensive personal card cost six hundred sixty thousand yuan per card while the most expensive corporate card cost 2.64 million yuan. In addition, each card charges an annual fee of 4,000 yuan.However, we frequently see civil servants who are wage-earners as well on the golf course. Is this phenomenon normal?(January 26, Modern Express)A media report claimed that many of the approximately 2,000 people in Hainan Province who are keen on the sport are Party and government cadres.Secretary of Changsha County Party Committee Li Zhen'e actually 'died in the line of duty' at the golf course.According to information, many cadres in Jiangsu are also golf club members.Even though a staff at a renowned golf club declined to reveal customers' information to the reporter, he admitted that civil servant is their major client group. "It is not only for making profits. Sometimes, we invite them on our own accord for all kinds of convenience and the club image."Committee Wang Yushi believed that it is very possible that someone 'foot the bill' for civil servants who participate in extravagant activities such as playing golf. It is hard not to suspect the acceptance of bribery.Therefore, in his proposal, he suggested discipline inspection commission and supervisory departments to conduct in-depth investigations into the phenomenon of civil servants playing golf. They should also enact and earnestly implement corresponding anti-corruption and promotion of clean government disciplines in order to step up the supervision of golf club members among civil servants.If necessary, they can ask procuratorial organs to start the investigation into civil servants on the golf club member registers, especially the suspicion of accepting bribes by leading cadres of the Party and the government.Investigating corruption of civil servants from golf club members is a good idea.We can also derive other anti-corruption means from this.For instance, some civil servants frequent high-class hotels, indulge in dissipation, lean on moneybags, and have casual relationships with women. Where does the funding of their spending come from?Some civil servants are very young and their salaries low but they spend money lavishly. They either buy sumptuous villas or top-grade sedans. Where do they get all this cash?Some civil servants neither have overseas background nor too much legitimate income. How can they send their children to study overseas at their own expense? Why do they have such strong financial strength?...In regard to these abnormal phenomena, the discipline inspection commission and supervisory departments have the authority and responsibility to find out the answers. They can either take the initiative to question them, or to travel incognito to listen to reactions of surrounding people, or to adopt proper measures in accordance with relevant regulations to conduct in-depth investigations.Relying on informants to uncover an offense and provide clues is no doubt an important breakthrough point in anti-corruption work. However, one can also find traces of corruption through the extravagant life and many abnormal high-consumption behaviors of cadres.Didn't we stress that we have to move the anti-corruption gateway forward? I believe to conduct in-depth investigation resolutely into civil servants' participation in extravagant activities such as playing golf is unquestionably much more proactive than acting on tips.In order to fight corruption, ideas should be extended and pre-emptive measures should be taken. We cannot wait until people are rotten to the core and even escape overseas before investigation and prosecution takes place.If so, then not only is it too late, the losses caused to the Party and the people are also too huge.
