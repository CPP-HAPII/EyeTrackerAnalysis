January 24, 2007 08:37In Tadayuki Funakura's opinion, quite often it is more necessary to understand the local background and cultural background in order to grasp the Chinese market.There is only one way to really understand the frontline and users: be physically present on the spot.Right now you might be immersed in your wonderful ideas of starting your business, but you will realize very soon that every wonderful idea will be made almost volatile by tons of trivial problems that are beyond your control.For instance, as your company has just been set up, telephones and computers are indispensible.Therefore, right after you have leased an office, you go to the nearby electronics mall to buy these two pieces of office equipment.The store owner tells you that you should also need a printer.You think that this is a reasonable suggestion.However, you realize very quickly that today's business information is not transmitted only through telephones and emails and that a fax machine is still indispensible.Very often, initial communication is carried out through emails, and documents like quotation proposals, after being signed and stamped, still need to be sent through a fax machine to the other party for confirmation. Following that, the original copy is mailed, and a phone call is made for confirmation.This business deal is almost done, but you will further realize that it would be best to have a scanner so that you could scan the original copy and email it to the customer. This would save a lot of hassle with mailing.Now your office desk is jam-packed with a telephone, a computer, a printer, a fax machine, and a scanner. Having had everything you need, you simply do not have any space for writing.After you have asked a computer-savvy friend to connect this bunch of machines to a network, you suddenly realize your office desk has become the desk of an administrative clerk. Every colleague invariably comes to your place to collect a fax or print a document. You want to think through some problems in peace but are constantly disturbed.The problem is far more than this.What is worse is that when any of these machines on your desk breaks down, you have to go and talk to the seller or even the manufacturer, and you will get into trivial disputes with many companies.Such scenario will not happen to you only once: you call and complain to the seller that your fax machine keeps breaking down, but after five minutes of conservation, the other party tells you they sell scanners.Your headache is never ending.You no longer have such a great dream. What you often think about is how great it would be if there was one machine that served as a telephone, a computer, a printer, a fax machine, a scanner, and more!You might not know that someone is currently searching everywhere in the world for you and for those people who suffer the same problems as you do.This person is named Tadayuki Funakura, the chairman of Konica Minolta Business Solutions (China) Co., Ltd.[1]
