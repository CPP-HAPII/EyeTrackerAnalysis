AFP on the 19th, BeijingPolice and eyewitnesses noted that in a number of major cities in China, including Beijing, there were crowds of people today staging protests against France over its attitude toward the Tibet issue and the Beijing Olympics.These anti-foreigners demonstrations, the largest of its kind over the three years in China, were mainly directed at the outlets of the Carrefour superstore in various locations because some Chinese individuals alleged that this French superstore chain group supported Tibet. However, the Group denied the allegation."Hundreds of people, mostly young people, gathered there in the morning. They all left before noon," said a store clerk in a bookstore near the Carrefour supermarket in Wuhan Municipality in central China.Another source said that according to the Wuhan police report, initially there were three hundred demonstrators, but by noontime, the number increased to 10,000.Xinhua News Agency reported that crowds of protesters shouted slogans such as "Boycott Carrefour" and "Oppose Tibet Independence."The agency reported protests occurring in Beijing, the eastern Chinese cities of Hefei and Qingdao, the southwestern city of Kunming as well as Wuhan.This was the first surge of protest by the Chinese side against France since France and China established diplomatic relations in 1964.Anti-France sentiments have been continuously on the rise in China since the Olympic torch relay turned into a riot in Paris when protesting crowds in support of Tibet independence attempted to grab the Olympic torch from fencer Jin Jing, who rode in a wheelchair.The sentiments further escalated when French President Sarkozy linked his attendance at the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony with the progress of human rights in Tibet.Xinhua News Agency and eyewitnesses noted that protests of smaller scale had also broken out around the French Embassy in Beijing and the adjacent French school neighborhood.Eyewitnesses said that about ten cars covered with five-star flags were driving around the French embassy before the police sealed the relevant area.Shortly afterwards, a small group of people, with placards in their hands, gathered in front of the French school.
