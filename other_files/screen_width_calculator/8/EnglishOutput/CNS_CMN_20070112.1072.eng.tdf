Turning vision into reality requires "the ability to plan, coordinate, and execute," and recommending immature thinking to the public is an irresponsible act.When attending the Question and Answer Session of the Legislative Council on the 11th, Donald Tsang took the initiative to mention in the opening his intention to participate in the election.He hopes that when he proposes the program for the next five years, he is "not only talking about vision instead of execution; not only talking about expenses while ignoring revenue; and not only talking about ideals but neglecting reality." Donald Tsang stressed that he would adhere to his consistent principle since he took over office as chief executive, which was "to do what is said."Donald Tsang believes that it is irresponsible for a chief executive or candidate of a chief executive to recommend immature thinking to the public."I strongly believe that all the legislative members are much more capable than I am in openly talking about future ideals and visions. However, it is a whole other matter for vision to become reality. It stresses the ability to plan, coordinate, and execute, and it needs repeat evaluation, repeat revision, and repeat consultation as well."He kept reiterating that while he currently still put his chief executive duty as the top priority, he was preparing to be a responsible candidate.He said he had heavy responsibilities as the current chief executive. "There is no room for mistakes when working hard with the citizens to maintain economic prosperity to let Hong Kong citizens be happy and live and work in peace and contentment." He stressed that the influence that his election campaign work had on daily administration should be minimized.Sung Lap Kung, a principal lecturer at Hong Kong City University's School of Continuing and Professional Education, believes that the reason Donald Tsang laid equal stress on vision and execution and combined ideals with reality this time is to make up for his lack of emphasis on short-term targets in the earlier administrative report.He thinks that if Donald Tsang announces his participation in the election, the program he proposes will be the administrative program for the next five years, and thorough preparation is needed in order to come up with an administrative program that is complete, extensive, detailed, and able to gain the approval of all parties.
