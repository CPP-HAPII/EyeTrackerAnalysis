London (AFP), 5th.Although French President Sarkozy warned that he probably won't attend the opening ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics due to the Tibet issue, British Prime Minister, Brown, still ruled out boycotting the Beijing Olympics today.After attending a meeting of international center-left leaders in London, Brown told reporters: "I will attend the Olympic (opening ceremonies) just like many other people."He also said: "The Dalai Lama himself said that he doesn't wish to see a boycott of the Olympics, so that's why I said, as the 2012 Olympic host country, I will attend."Brown called on the two sides of the Tibet crisis to show "restraint," and said that this crisis can only be solved through dialogue.
