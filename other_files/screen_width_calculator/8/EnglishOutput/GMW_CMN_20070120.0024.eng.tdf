By Bi Wenzhang, January 20, 2007Some regions merely pay lip service to the support of supervision by public opinion, but do not implement it into their actual deeds.Once a journalist from the media dares to supervise them by public opinion, he will encounter all sorts of obstacles, and may even suffer from retaliations and revenge.This is a typical case of Lord Ye's love of dragons - pretending to like something that he really fears.So, are there any regions that zealously welcome supervision by public opinion?Yes, there is.According to the Beijing News on January 14, media journalists who file supervision by public opinion reports in Chenzhou in Hunan Province are not only likely to receive the "Supervision by Public Opinion Award"; they will also stand a chance to be conferred as "Honorable Citizens" of Chenzhou City.On January 11, the Office of the CPC Chenzhou Municipal Committee and the Office of the Chenzhou Municipal People's Government forwarded the "Opinions on Giving Further Support for the Work of News Media" issued by the Department of Publicity of the CPC Chenzhou Municipal Committee to counties, cities and regions under its administration, as well as organs and agencies directly administrated by the municipal government. The document mentioned the establishment of the "Supervision by Public Opinion Award," and "specially awarding journalists from central and provincial media who proactively offer clues of supervision by public opinion to Chenzhou for investigation, as well as those who greatly promote the work of Chenzhou through supervision by public opinion."As the saying goes, "Domestic shame should not be made public." Such an incorrect perception has already existed for hundreds of years, ah, it is hard to change it within a short period of time.Especially for such a sensitive issue as supervision by public opinion, many CPC committees and governments stick to the principle of "turning big problems into small problems, and small problems into no problem at all." Hence, few people are willing to "reveal their scars in public."Such concepts and deeds are contrary to the specific requirements of honor and disgrace under socialism, as they bring endless harm and no benefit to our undertakings.Hunan's Chenzhou has fully realized the seriousness of this problem, and had taken the lead in setting up a Supervision by Public Opinion Award.Their deed is in line with the needs of reform and innovation, and is a manifestation of keeping pace with the times.They are worthy of other places to learn from, and should be widely promoted.CPC Chenzhou Municipal Committee secretary Ge Hongyuan noted that the supervision of public opinion by the media is an important part of the supervisory system. While providing positive reports, it is absolutely necessary for the mainstream media to shed light on the ugly phenomena in society, a move that is also very important to the development of an area.The "Award for Supervision by Public Opinion" has been set up with the support of the CPC Chenzhou Municipal Committee, as well as the Municipal People's Government of Chenzhou, with the aim of supporting the news media in carrying out their work with "a more open-minded thinking and a more enlightened attitude."Personally, I believe that the measure taken by Chenzhou is of great significance, which will surely play an important role in promoting supervision by public opinion.However, there is still a flaw in an otherwise perfect thing.As everyone knows, Chenzhou is regarded as a place with frequent occurrence of news in 2006.It's a pity that the earthquake in the official circles was first reported by media from other provinces; as for the floods caused by Typhoon "Bilis," Chenzhou-administered Zixing was suspected of hiding the number of deaths, and it was the central media who had to be troubled to disclose the matter from afar.The promulgation of "New Regulations for Supervision by Public Opinion" this time is still aimed at giving special awards to "central and provincial media."I'm afraid if a similar incident occurs in Chenzhou, even if local officials are magnanimous enough to "present awards," the local media most familiar with the Chenzhou situation will have to stand by and witness others "receiving awards."This is very unfair to the local media in Chenzhou.Thus, in my opinion, the local media in Chenzhou should also be allowed to compete for the Supervision by Public Opinion Award, so as to avoid irresponsible remarks from the masses.I wonder if Chenzhou city will consider my suggestion as feasible?Don't forget, ah, the masses are waiting for your answer.
