Washington (AFP), 26th.A US Democratic Party official said that the Democratic party bosses plan to judge proposals for counting Florida and Michigan primary results on May 31. This will probably help solve the Democratic Party's intensely competitive presidential nomination battle.Last year, the Democratic National Convention decided to punish Florida and Michigan by not including their party delegates because these two states held their primaries for the nomination early.However, there were objections from Democratic Party members, demanding that party delegates from these two states be counted so that the voters of these two states are also allowed to participate in the decision of whether Hillary Clinton or Obama will represent the Democratic Party in November's presidential election.The Michigan state Democratic Party primary, with more than 150 party delegates, finished on January 15th. The Florida state primary, with 210 party delegates, finished on January 29th. Both of these states were won by Hillary.Yesterday, the National Convention already sent members a memorandum saying the committee will hear the different opinions of delegates from the Democratic Party's Florida and Michigan party chapters. These two states request that state delegates gain permission to attend the Democratic National Convention that will be held in August.Anonymous blogger "Mr. Superdelegate" wrote: "The memorandum requests a meeting on May 31st."
