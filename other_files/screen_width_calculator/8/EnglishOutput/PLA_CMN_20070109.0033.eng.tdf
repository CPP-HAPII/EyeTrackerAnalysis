(Source: PLA Daily, Page 2, Time of Release: 2007-01-09 06:41)Staff Report, Jinan, January 8, Special Correspondent Li Deying Reporting: At the start of the new year, Wang Huainan, a senior engineer at the technical division of a section in the Jinan Military Command, has had two pleasant surprises. He has appeared on the command's "ten-five" individual roll of honor as an advanced science and technology worker, and the "portable field-use solar power source" that he designed and developed himself has received the military award for the advancement of technology.As of now, he has achieved 76 scientific research results in the 32 years since he entered the military. Of these, 16 have received military awards for the advancement of technology, and 33 have been promoted for use throughout the entire military.How has an army engineer in the mountains won so many honors for scientific research and innovation?Section leader Zang Weijin dispels the mystery with a single remark: "He has benefited from the consistent and strong support of the Party committee members for six terms."32 years ago, Wang Huainan entered the military with only an elementary school education and came to this base deep in the mountains to be a repairman.Senior officers found out that he would often use his off-duty time to learn and make small inventions and small innovations.Senior officers encouraged him and allotted a workshop specially for him.Wang Huainan studied hard day and night, worked his way through all the courses in middle school, high school, and university for a science and engineering major. He taught himself professional electronics, mechanics, weapons and ammunition, and several other subjects.In the third year he developed a "platform crane." The Party committee awarded him a third-class merit.Six years later, another team of Party committee leaders took office. They were even more supportive of Wang Huainan, breaking with the conventional seniority system to appoint him the head of the project team.In February 1993, in order to broaden Wang Huainan's vision, a new team of Party committee leaders recommended him for the World Military Mechanical Equipment Exhibition held in Guangzhou to do a demonstration for military mechanical experts from over 70 nations.His excellent demonstrations made the experts of every nation treat him with increased respect.In the blink of an eye another two three-year terms had gone by. To make Wang Huainan's scientific research projects follow the needs of the military more closely, the teams in these two terms recommended that he go to other military divisions to learn and undergo on-job training, which allowed him to improve his abilities in the course of his work.At the beginning of 2003, the sixth team of Party committee members took office. They invested 1.4 million yuan in purchasing and upgrading equipment for Wang Huainan and setting up a laboratory for innovation.With greater enthusiasm, Wang Huainan successively developed innovative projects such as a high-efficiency charger, a dust remover for an internal combustion engine, a portable field electric circuit detector, a field transport equipment repair shelter, and anti-slip transport equipment.Of these, the "A/C electric cart" has increased efficiency in loading and unloading by over 40 times and has been formally provided for promotional use across the whole military.Commentary after CompilationWu TianminWhy Are There "No Big Trees in the Cities?"Along the sides of the major roads in some cities you very seldom see large trees. Older than a hundred years, they're very uncommon; a few decades or more, there still aren't many.Where have the big trees gone?They've been chopped down.Building roads, Mayor A chops down a bunch and plants a bunch. Building skyscrapers, Mayor B chops down a bunch and plants a bunch... Plant and chop down, chop down and plant, and so there are "no big trees in the cities."It takes ten years to grow a tree and a hundred years to bring up a useful person.For a tree to grow it needs to have a stable, spacious environment. For talents to grow, it's the same idea.To allow talents to grow "from sprouts into big trees," you must sincerely love talents, cherish talents, use talents, and foster talents in the long term. Not hot one minute, cold the next; not one thing in the morning, another by evening.Wang Yongzhi, chief engineer in the manned spaceflight program, once said: "The major achievement of China's manned spaceflight program is not sending astronauts into space. More importantly, it has taken the persistent efforts of generations of people and has fostered a team of space specialists who have the ability to win tough battles."This enlightening idea is very adequate and invaluable for us when we implement a strategic talent project under the guidance of the scientific view of development and when we plan the building of our team of talented individuals with a long term perspective.
