It has intensified its efforts in the area of medical support, achieving some twenty achievements in scientific research that will boost the enhancement of the troop battle capacity.The Party Committee of the hospital found that, for a period of time, some departments had unilaterally sought economic benefit and had deviated from future war needs in their selection of programs.In response, the hospital launched a discussion entitled "How Should Scientific Research Serve Battle Capacity" among its staff so as to strengthen everybody's sense of mission.On this foundation, medical personnel were sent to troop training grounds to practice assuring parallel medical support during exercises and to seek out prospective programs.When examining a suggested program, they invited experts in military training and medical support for demonstration and checking so as to assure that the suggested program matched future battle needs.Eleven programs that directly serve the building of battle effectiveness, including "Studies on Functional Failure of Multiple Organs Caused by Injury in Military Training" and "Studies on Multi-mode Pain Mitigation after Field Operation", have been selected as the key topics of the hospital for this year.They also focus on field testing of their scientific research achievements on troop training grounds, including a "field operation vehicle", "portable mini-Respirator" and "first-aid kit for burns", which have been improved continuously during comprehensive exercises of the troops.In recent years, the results achieved by the hospital in scientific research, including "Wartime Metal Detector-Taker" and a "Tracheal Catheter of a Certain Model", have found use in combat readiness training of troops and become the growth pole of medical support for troops.
