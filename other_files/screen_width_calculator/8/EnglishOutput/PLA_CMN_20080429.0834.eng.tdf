They consider it a small matter not to be considered wholeheartedly. They skip payments, pay late, pay extra next time, etc. This reflects that these comrades have a fading party consciousness, and a weakening concept of party spirit.In the war years, before many revolutionaries martyred and sacrificed themselves, none forgot to pay their final party fee.After the West Road Army's Female Group's female soldiers were scattered by their enemies, many comrades lost the party for many years but always saved up their party fee.These types of lofty thoughts of unlimited loyalty in the party they held, are worth our eternal study.The party's 17th Congress report points out that all party comrades, especially the leading cadres, should all display party spirit, value one's behavior and be a model. The central politics department recently printed and distributed "Regarding Military Party Fees Collection, Usage and Management Methods." This is our military's first specialized legislation for the systematic standardization of party fee collection, usage and management. It contains very strong realistic targeting and guiding meaning for the strengthening of both the party's basic organizational construction and party member team construction.As the sayings go: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, holding a tree starts with taking small pieces; A flood barrier can be broken by an ant hill, a balloon can be popped by a needle.Party fee work and each party member are closely connected. Regarding party spirit, valuing one's behavior and being a model, not only should one pay attention to large matters, but they should also value small matters starting from willingly paying party fees on time and guaranteeing the effective implementation of party fee collection, usage and management regulations.
