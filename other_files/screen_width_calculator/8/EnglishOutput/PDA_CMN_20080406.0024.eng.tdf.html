April 06, 2008Chiang family descendants, Chiang Hsiao-yen and Chiang Yu-song, went to the Tsihu and Touliao together on the 5th to pay respects to the buried ancestors. As for whether or not the two Chiangs will be moved to the Mainland for burial, Chiang Hsiao-yen said that most of the family members think that this topic is too sensitive and doesn't need to be touched upon. Instead the two Chiangs can be buried nearby and enter the ground peacefully.According to a report from Taiwan's ETTV, Chiang Ching-kuo's son, Chiang Hsiao-yen and his wife went to Tsihu together with Chiang Ching-kuo's first grandson, Chiang Yu-song, on the 5th to pay respects to the buried ancestors. As for the opinion on moving the two Chiangs' tombs back to the Mainland for burial, Chiang Hsiao-yen stressed that his opinion is the same as Chiang Yu-song. They both think that it isn't needed.Nationalist Party "legislator" Chiang Hsiao-yen, said that most of the family members think moving it is not as good as keeping it still and the current situation should be maintained now. As for the matter of moving the tomb to the Mainland, it's currently not suitable to touch on this subject.Allowing the two Chiangs to be buried locally in Taiwan can evade the sensitive tomb moving issue. As for the position of the two Chiangs, the difference in perception between the blues and greens is very large. Chiang Hsiao-yen also doesn't insist that it is necessary for the two Chiangs' bodies to be managed in a "national burial."However, Chiang Hsiao-yen still called on Ma Ying-jeou to not just make the tombs open for one day. He hopes Ma Ying-jeou will be able to let the tombs of the two Chiangs be delivered from oppression and allow the public to freely visit everyday.
