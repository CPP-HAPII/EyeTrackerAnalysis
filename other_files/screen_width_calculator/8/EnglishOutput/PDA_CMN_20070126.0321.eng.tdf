January 26, 2007 08:27An article in the British newspaper The Guardian dated January 23, originally headlined "Beijing forecasts heavy spring sandstorms" Beijing will probably suffer from more serious sandstorms than in normal years this spring due to this unusually warm winter.Higher-than-average temperatures and critically low snowfall have exacerbated this problem.An official from Beijing Municipality's Environmental Protection Bureau has pointed out, "Warm, dry weather loosens the soil, and when the wind lifts in spring, it can easily give rise to sandstorm weather.Consequently, Beijing could possibly face severe pollution from sandstorms this spring."Soil desertification and persistent drought has exacerbated the problem of sandstorms in recent years.Beijing, which suffered 17 sandstorm attacks in 2006, pledged to hold a sandstorm-free Olympics in 2008 and has launched campaigns to restore vegetation on exposed earth and rein in over-grazing and over-logging.But environmental protection officials admit that China, one-third of whose national land area is taken up by deserts, will find it hard to completely tame sandstorms, because China's desertified area is too large.In order to improve air quality in the capital, Beijing will adopt a series of measures in 2007, including upgrading 1,100 boilers, canceling 2,580 high-polluting public transport buses, and enforcing "Euro 4" emission standards for all new vehicles in 2008.An article in South Korea's JoongAng Ilbo dated January 23, originally headlined "Yellow sanddust will attack in spring, and China expects a bad year" China's environmental protection authorities have informed South Koreans that the spring will see an attack of "yellow sanddust," and sandstorms in China in 2007 will probably be more serious than in normal years.The western China and Inner Mongolian regions are the origins of the yellow sandstorms, and there was almost no snow in these regions this winter.According to experts, in years when these regions experience snowfall exceeding 10 days, sandstorms in the following spring are less severe, whereas dry earth can aggravate sandstorms.Last year, Beijing experienced 17 days of suffocating sandstorm weather.Beijing Municipality's environmental protection experts have said that overall air pollution, including sandstorms, will continue to get worse over the next 5 years.The former South Korean ambassador to China, Kwon Byong-hyon, is leading an organization called the Korea-China Future Forest Association, which is attempting to plant enough trees in Inner Mongolia to ease desertification.â–²(Translated by Chen Yi)Global Times (Page 06, 2007-01-24)
