Fu Yiming, Ling Junhui, Reporters of Xinhua News Agency (Source: Xinhua News Agency, Dispatch time: January 3 2007 21:18)After eliminating Xinjiang players Abu Lajiang and Cao Xinnong with two 5-4 victories in the quarterfinals and semifinals at the China Snooker Championship to advance with difficulties on the 1st, the snooker wonderkid Ding Junhui rose to the challenge on the 2nd and won with an overwhelming 6-2 victory over his fellow junior student Xiao Guodong.The ability of the snooker wonderkid who came from Yixing, Jiangsu was rather short of what he wanted to do in the few rounds of competitions before the semifinals due to the exhaustion caused by jam-packed competitions. He won the first four competitions all with difficulties. However, he lived up to people's expectations and displayed standard and traits of world top notch players before his hometown folks."I had too little practice time before the competitions, thus my condition was unsteady and it caused many mistakes." In the first four sets, he had a 2:2 result. Ding Junhui said during the half-time.Continuous fatigue was indeed too much for him to cope with.Cao Xinnong, who had a hot competition in the semifinals with him, said that snooker is in fact a competitive sport that consumes a great deal of brainpower and physical strength. "The body almost collapses after a competition." "Good results require good shape." Deputy Secretary-General of Jiangsu Province Billiards and Snooker Association Shi Ming stated that the huge fluctuations in Ding Junhui's condition were due to fatigue.In regards to the 'slow pickup' from the beginning of the competition to getting into the state of mind, being unaccustomed to the pool tables, and the comparison of his mental state with his opponents', it seemed that we could use 'dispirited' to conclude Ding Junhui's mental state during these four days of competitions.Since the high-sounding withdrawal from the semifinals in the British Premier League Snooker Competitions to represent China to compete in the Doha Asian games to the failure to defend his title in the UK Championship that followed right after, competing fiercely in nine competitions that stretched over two continents in 20 days had exhausted Ding Junhui both physically and mentally.Since he successfully entered the quarterfinals in the reputed Wembley Masters Competition in 2005, this 19-year-old Chinese boy quickly drew wide attention in the British Isles known as the Snooker Kingdom.Afterwards, Ding Junhui beat the seven times champion and star Hendry in the British Premier League Snooker Competitions 2006 but gave up the semifinals qualification to represent China to compete in Doha instead.During the Asian Games, Ding Junhui competed in all snooker competitions including five doubles, four groups, and five singles and swept three gold medals.He competed in 53 sets. During that period, he spent approximately seven hours in the arena.Behind the impressive achievements were extremely tight competition schedule, causing this boy who is only 19-years-old to feel worn out."I had never played such jam-packed games," Ding Junhui felt as if a great weight had been lifted after the Doha Games. "I was almost in the snooker stadium all day in these four days."The competitions in the Asian Games had just ended, and Ding Junhui had to rush to Britain to take part in the UK Championships.He, who had played nine games that stretched over two continents in 20 days was finally defeated by former World Champion Peter Ebdon in a 5:9 loss. His dream to defend his title was thus shattered.For Ding Junhui, competing 9 out of the 10 days with an average of more than two games per day was a very severe test of his body and mind.After the competition, Ding Junhui said frankly that he was too tired. He said regrettably, "I feel very tired and I am not in top condition. I missed many key balls." In the words of Ding Junhui's British agent Gary, during these days, "Xiao Hui 'carries his suitcase' to enter the competitions". His defeat in the quarterfinals of the UK Championships finally made outsiders realized that Ding Junhui was really tired.Ding Junhui also played with extreme difficulties during the four-day China Championship of Professional Snooker competition.Apparently, competing under an overly tight schedule with exhaustion would certainly prevent him from playing to his full strength.After the competition, Ding Junhui candidly said that the main cause of the toughness in the competition and his twice dragging into the final set by his opponents was the 'unsystematic training recently that led to his poor feel for the ball and reduced control, thus the extreme difficulties in the competition."No doubt, players who are trained under both the national and social systems must strike a balance between the nation's and personal interests. Thus, it goes without saying that having to compete consecutively in closely scheduled competitions with physical and mental exhaustion will affect the performance.However, the conflict created by the co-existence of the two systems will not change in the near future. What players can do is to adjust their state of mind and find a balance that suits themselves.Ding Junhui's agent Zhang Mengzeng said, "As a professional player, he must face all these including tough competitions and severe eliminations. All these will help him in his future developments."Ding Junhui will rush to Beijing on the 3rd and then travel directly to Britain to prepare for the Welsh Snooker Open. While the China Open, the World Championships, and the Malta Cup that closely follow will also come one after another.No matter what, this 19-year-old snooker wonderkid will bear the anticipation of fellow countrymen and continue to advance bravely toward another high point of his professional life.
