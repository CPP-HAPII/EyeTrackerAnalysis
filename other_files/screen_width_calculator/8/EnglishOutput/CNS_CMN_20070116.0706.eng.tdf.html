But luckily he was able to obtain the right to continue participating in the competition."The competition during the ninth stage was very tough. Only 61 vehicles completed the race within the specified time.Taking into account the unique situation, the organizing committee has finally allowed vehicles that had returned to the camp before the departure of the next race stage to continue in the competition.According to information from the frontline, Lu Ningjun has returned to the camp," said the Chinese Triangle Tire team news manager, An Ziming.He said that Lu Ningjun's crash during the third stage had affected him tremendously, and this has resulted in the subsequent difficulties of the race."It is as if a BMW has been smashed and turned into a Santana. The power, performance, and so on of the car had suffered tremendous injury."Chinese racer Liu Bin, representing the Mitsubishi team, came in 38th in this competitive stage with a result of 7 hours, 43 minutes, and 35 seconds. His total ranking rose to 52nd.After the race, Liu Bin said, "The race went smoothly today.The car had relatively good maintenance yesterday, hence it was able to run a little faster today.Basically there were no big problems, except for one tire puncture.""It can be said that the real Dakar is the day after the rest day. The two competitive stages yesterday and today added up to more than 1,000 kilometers, and moreover, there was no maintenance and there were slightly relatively more deserts. This has made it more demanding for both the drivers and their vehicles.Along the way, I saw many cars, including the two Volkswagen cars in the lead, which had broken down on the road," Liu Bin said.Schlesser, the famous French driver from the Ford team, came in first in this stage with a result of 5 hours, 32 minutes, and 03 seconds. Defending champion Alphand emerged second with a difference of 13 seconds, and another famous French driver, Peterhansel, came in third.The racing car of De Villiers, a South African driver from the Volkswagen team, who was originally leading in the overall rankings, suddenly caught fire in the middle of the race, hence affecting his results significantly, and causing him to be replaced by Peterhansel.
