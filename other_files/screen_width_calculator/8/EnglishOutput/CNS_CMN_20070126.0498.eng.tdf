Let Homes and Home Loans Both Generate MoneyJanuary 26, 2007 09:29Investors who consult with professional financial planners can maximize investment returns on a reasonable basis, by utilizing already invested real estate for rents, mortgages, and loans, among other things.China News Service, Photo by Ren ShikeHaving started work and established some financial foundation, what is the first financial planning target to consider?Ninety percent of people will give this answer: buy a home.After buying a first home, what do you do with extra cash then?Many people will either arrange to buy a second home or invest in a shop.Analyzed Lu Aiping, chief financial planner at Huayan Real Estate Financial Planning Center, "This is a very common phenomenon. Most people still have a relatively conservative investment mentality. They believe that compared with cash and financial planning products with floating returns, homes are the most solid assets."Between 2003 and 2004, there was a housing market boom, with home buyers standing in long queues and snatching up homes. Right now, there are many people who own two or three homes.Real estate investment constitutes the greater part of people's financial planning activity. However, buying a home means that capital is lying dormant, causing a dilemma where people have money to buy homes but no money for investment.Huayan has advanced a brand new financial planning concept for real estate, a method for managing money whereby investors consult with professional financial planners to maximize investment returns on a reasonable basis, by utilizing already invested real estate for rents, mortgages, and loans, among other things.Huayan Real Estate Financial Planning Center has built a platform for homeowners to find numerous investment shortcuts, to allow not only their homes, but also home loans to generate money.Back in 2004 when there was a lot of speculation in the housing market, upper management at Huayan was already thinking about future real estate market trends, that with market fluctuation, home prices would have to fall someday. When that time comes, with home vacancies as the biggest problem, how should homeowners use their real estate for financial planning?After in-depth consideration, they realized that many things could be done through real estate.The most difficult part about cashing out real estate is cash conversion and transferring the real estate.As there are a lot of taxes in the transfer process, the transfer costs are quite high.Huayan plans to let homeowners earn returns of about 8% by getting home equity loans through banks and investing in small enterprises with good prospects but with financing difficulties.This resolves small enterprises' financing difficulties, and also find an outlet for the equity in homes, thereby cashing out fixed assets and opening a channel for the stagnant water to flow."Our market operating strategy is to race with banks, attracting customers by finding interest rates between those of mortgage firms and banks," said Ms. Lu Aiping.One can see that Huayan has found a market niche between banks and mortgage institutions.For a bank, it can attract large customers using brand effect, and naturally does not want to spend the same amount of effort and time for small customers.Furthermore, banks have more cautious credit mechanisms, and do not have mechanisms which combine home loans with investment and financing.When borrowing from banks, small enterprises usually need to go through a complicated process which takes at least two months and as much as six months. Small enterprise customers have high cash turnover, with money coming in and out quickly. Their funding needs are time-sensitive and cannot be delayed.Through Huayan Real Estate Financial Planning Center, financing can be obtained within one to seven days just by calling and asking about loan conditions. If all documentation is complete, it is also possible to receive a loan on the same day. There have already been successful cases like this."We quickly find successful matches, allowing real estate customers' funds to enter the money-earning channel as soon as possible, making customers who cash out real estate equity very happy," said Ms. Lu."In terms of financing costs, the annual interest rate is about 20%, while it is at least 36% through mortgage firms."Most of the financing planning that Huayan does is one-off short-term financing within a six-month period. Those who mortgage their homes and cash out get returns of between 8% and 10%, surpassing average stable financial planning products at banks.In addition, mortgaged real estate can still be rented out, and this income is calculated separately.For instance, Mr. Wang, who earns 150,000 yuan per year, has two homes in the city. Of these, Home A has a 2,000 yuan per month mortgage; Home B is a full title with an assessed value of 1.5 million and monthly rent of 3,500 yuan.Mr. Wang very much wants to make money on these two real estate properties of his.A professional financial planner from Huayan Real Estate Financial Planning Center formulated this plan for Mr. Wang: After mortgaging Home B, almost one million can be cashed out to be loaned as a personal mortgage loan in the name of Huayan.Calculating for a one-year one million yuan loan at 10% annual interest, the one-year return is 30,000 yuan after deducting the cost of 70,000 yuan needed to get the equity loan on Home B.Since the amount of one million yuan is secured by properly mortgaging a legal real estate property in comparable value provided by the financier, it is a very sound investment plan.[1]
