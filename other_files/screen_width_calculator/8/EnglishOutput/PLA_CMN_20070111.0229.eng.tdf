Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 11 (Reporter Wang Jintao). The Chengdu Railways Bureau released information on the 11th that the comprehensive testing on our nation's first ballastless railway track was completed on the night of the 10th.The testing result showed a trial speed of the freight train reaching 232 kilometers per hour. Its smoothness and comfortable level had achieved excellent level. All testing data were within safety standard.In September 2004, the Ministry of Railways decided to build our nation's first ballastless track trial section at the Sui Yu Railway. The regular line is 13.16 kilometers long.Under the leadership and direction of the Ministry of Railways, the trial section task team persisted in independent innovation and integrated usage, production, study, and research to finish building the first ballastless track trial section of which our nation has the independent intellectual property rights after almost 28 months of arduous struggle.The comprehensive testing on the Sui Yu Railway ballastless track trial section began on January 3, 2007.In railways, 'ballast' means small pieces of stones.All regular railways lay sleepers or cement and steel tracks with ballast as the foundation. However, this type of railway is not suitable for trains to travel high speed.According to information, the Sui Yu trial section broke the limit of laying ballastless track on big overpass for the first time, laid ballastless track switch for the first time, grasped the syntonic rail circuit transmission technology used by ballastless track for the first time, and built a section of ballastless track railway for the first time.Results of the comprehensive testing showed: All indices met safety standard when the freight train passed the switch. The roadbed structure of ballastless track could fulfill the requirements of smoothness and comfortable level of the running of high-speed trains. The bridge structure of ballastless track could meet the operational safety requirement of passenger train traveling 200 kilometers and above. The design and building of our nation's first ballastless track had reached world's advanced standard.According to the planning of the 11th Five Year Plan of the Ministry of Railways, our nation will build 7,000 kilometers of special passenger line by the year 2010 and form an initial high-speed passenger transport network that connects all major large and medium-sized cities across the nation with special passenger lines as its nucleus.Developments of world high-speed railways confirm that if regular track system is used in the foundation work of high-speed railways, railway ballast suffers serious pulverization, railway maintenance is frequent, and the safety level, comfortable level, and economic value are relatively low.Ballastless track is the development direction of high-speed railway construction technique.According to investigation, the Ministry of Railways attached great importance to the comprehensive testing of the first ballastless track. Three hundred forty technicians had directly participated in the testing.Thirteen experts including member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering Chen Xin rode on a freight train to take part in the entire comprehensive testing.In the Sui Yu Railway Ballastless Track Comprehensive Trial Section Technique Seminar, engineers, technicians, and experts highly praised the technical innovation results and significance of our nation's first ballastless track trial section and adopted the Minutes of the Sui Yu Ballastless Track Comprehensive Trial Section Technique Seminar.(The end)
