April 27, 2008The Argentine Central Bank released an announcement on the 26th saying that in order to respond to the Argentine financial market's U.S. Dollar buying craze, the Argentine central bank sold off 300 million US Dollars of its foreign reserves to the market on the 25th, making it the bank's largest recorded one-day sell off of U.S. Dollars in the past 6 years.An Argentine central bank official said the change of the Minister of Economy of the Argentine government caused the public and investors to worry about economic policies. They all bought U.S. Dollars one after another, resulting in the Argentine Peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate dropping to its lowest level since January of 2003.Due to inadequate advance preparation, some Argentine banks experienced inadequate U.S. Dollar reserves, which further aggravated the public's panic.For this reason, the Argentine central bank urgently intervened in the market, selling off 100 million U.S. Dollars within less than one hour of the foreign exchange market opening on the 25th and afterwards selling off more batches of U.S. Dollars in order to stabilize the exchange rate.By the time the day's foreign exchange market closed, the Argentine central bank sold off 300 million U.S. Dollars in foreign exchange.The goal set by the Argentine central bank was to set the Argentine Peso to U.S. Dollar exchange rate at about 1 to 3.20 in the short-term.Economists warned that Argentina's macro-economy is currently fundamentally very good, but the government's economic policies aren't very clear. The measures to contain currency inflation are especially incompetent.If the government cannot stabilize the market in the short term, the Peso's depreciation will likely accelerate, resulting in a severe shock to the financial market and initiating a wide-spread pull-out of foreign investment.
