(Source: PLA Daily 2nd edition, Dispatch time: January 24, 2007 06:31)Staff Reporter, Shenyang, January 23, Liu Jianwei. I walked into the First Company of new soldiers of a Shenyang military region regiment this morning and saw dozen of new soldiers gathering in front of the computer to read the "Veterans' Diaries" on the LAN.According to information, the regiment organ tapped teaching resources around them and posted over 1,000 pieces of veterans' diaries on the LAN.New soldiers show great interest in this column. It has over 3,000 hits in less than two months.In recent years, once new soldiers joined the camp, the regiment will organize them to write army diary and encourage them to record their 'early soldier life' in their original flavor.Many soldiers have accumulated several thick books of diary in a few years.These diaries have become precious materials and many soldiers take the diaries with them when they retire from the army.When the veterans retired last yearend, some of them left their work dairies for the regiment as gifts.When the regiment leaders read the veterans' diaries, they found that a lot of the diary contents were full, accurate, vivid, and touching. If they recommended these diaries to new soldiers as selective materials, they would play an inspirational and teaching role to them.In order to do this, they selected and organized the diaries and launched the Veterans' Diaries special column on the LAN.Piece after piece of diary that record veterans' army life thus become the window through which new soldiers understand the troops and their 'treasure box' to resolve problems.New soldier Wang Mingming received the news of his mother's passing away less than a week after he was enlisted.During his sorrow, he saw the diary of veteran Squad Leader Zhang Minghui. He found that the veteran squad leader had similar experience as his. However, the veteran squad leader turned grief into strength and devoted fully to the study and training, thus making many achievements.Wang Mingming was deeply moved. He said, "My mother wanted me to do well in the army. The best way to repay my mother is to achieve."The regiment Political Commissar Hu Chongtao stated that under the influence of the veterans' diaries, new soldiers also pick up their pens and start writing their own army diaries one after another.
