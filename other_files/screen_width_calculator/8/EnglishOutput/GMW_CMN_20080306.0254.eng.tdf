This newspaper's reporter, Xiao Guozhong - Special reporter Liu Dahong 2008-03-06Reporter: as the metallurgy industry's only CPPCC member to be in the 10th and 11th term, how do you regard the mission and responsibilities of the committee members?Yu Tianzhen: I deeply feel that shouldering the mission of participating in management of State affairs is very sacred and that the responsibility of representing the interests of a large group of workers is also very important.I think being a member of the CPPCC is a type of mission, a responsibility -- a responsibility to the country and to the people.Reporter: As a member of the CPPCC, which issues of the national economy and people's livelihood were your main concerns during the past few years?Yu Tianchen: In 2004, seeing a more and more obvious discrepancy between supply and demand of iron ore, I went to areas rich in iron ore and large-scale state-owned iron mines one after another to carry out thorough inspection and research on site.I realized that due to the scourge of regional protectionism and incompetent legal monitoring system enforcement, some regional enterprises blindly and indiscriminately mined. The phenomenon of private enterprises indiscriminately mining without permits happened over and over again. This seriously interfered with the normal production of state iron mines and also resulted in serious erosion of iron ore resources.In order to thoroughly solve this issue, from the aspects of strengthening mineral resource legal system administration, formulating policies that foster development of state-owned iron mines and another 6 aspects, I submitted to the central government the proposal "About Scientific Mining, Policy Recommendation for the Reasonable Protection of Mineral Resources."The proposal aroused much attention from State Council leaders. The National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Land and Resources, Ministry of Finance and other departments combined the 16 recommendations I submitted, specifically formulated a series of policies and rules that opened a new channel to solve the state-owned iron ore supply shortage "old hard" issue.In the second half of 2005, while visiting over 80 key enterprises that use BX Steel's "Double High" product, I realized that some of our country's enterprises', especially particularly large state-owned enterprises', ability to independently innovate was seriously inadequate.Thus, I made "make enterprises main body of technological innovation" a key subject. After visiting important industries and enterprises to carry out special subject research and policy discussion, I finally formed a proposal with 13 recommendations called "Policy Recommendations Regarding Making Enterprises the Main Body of Technology Innovation" that involved 3 aspects of "perfecting the policy environment, increasing capital investment, promoting the application of results," etc.This proposal, that truly reflected the important issues of national economic development that urgently needed to be solved, aroused the enormous attention of the State Council's relevant departments and also became an important proposal for that year's two conferences.On March 5, 2007, at a symposium for the group consideration of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's government work report, I combined my understanding of retired workers' "basic pension" payment problems in petrochemicals, transportation, equipment manufacturing and other businesses and put out a proposal for scientific adjustment of "basic pension" for retired workers.After the meeting ended, I wrote the proposal "About Raising Retired Worker's 'Basic Pensions'" and submitted it to the CPPCC in order to establish a specialized department or temporary work agency to scientifically solve the problem of inadequate pay for retired workers. The proposal immediately aroused support of council members from businesses.Reporter: At these two meetings, what proposals do you plan to submit?Yu Tianzhen: After attending the party's 17th congress, I seriously summarized the steel and iron industry's technological innovation situation over the past few years. I deeply feel that enterprises, especially particularly large-scale state-owned enterprises, are the backbones and pillars of economic construction. Comprehensively advancing scientific innovation is enterprise's eternal theme and is also an important issue for healthy, fast and sustainable socio-economic development. For enterprises to actualize scientific innovation, they must untiringly work their hardest. Even more so, it requires central and local governments to give proactive support from the aspects of "accelerating service role development, ceaselessly perfecting policy rules, accelerating the application of scientific results," etc.Therefore, to arouse everybody's recognition and attention, I've prepared to submit a proposal about "ceaselessly improving policies, changing the government's role and speeding up the application of technological results."
