AFP on the 12th, Dar es Salaam, TanzaniaThe Flame symbolizing the 2008 Beijing Olympics arrived today under tightened security in Dar es Salaam, the largest city in Tanzania, beginning the only torch relay in Africa, which is actually low-risk, though drastically curtailed.At present no anti-China demonstration activities in support of Tibet have been planned to take place tomorrow in Dar es Salaam, but the originally planned 25-kilometer torch relay has already shrunk to a two-hour, five-kilometer run in the large Tanzanian commercial city of Dar es Salaam.Dar es Salaam is situated on the shores of the Indian Ocean, and the city government has vowed to boost security along the torch relay route. Mayor Kimbisa said that tomorrow's torch relay has been downscaled "because there has been a lot of rain in Tanzania." He frankly admitted to AFP yesterday, "Of course, there could be two or three crazy people who would want to disrupt the torch relay."However, "I would like to assure the public that there is no need to worry. We are in charge of the overall situation, and we shall ensure that the Olympic torch relay in Tanzania is a success," said Kimbisa in a statement.Dar es Salaam police said that security will be deployed along the torch relay route, maintaining "high alert."The Beijing Olympics torch relay, which has been followed everywhere by protests like shadows, will have Tanzania as its only stop in Africa. The city government said that Dar es Salaam is determined to become the first city to host a protest-free torch relay and is hoping to follow in the footsteps of Buenos Aires.
