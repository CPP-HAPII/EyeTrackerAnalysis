Sydney, 20th (AFP)Australian actress Kate Blanchett's six-day-old son stole the spotlight today from the more than one thousand important citizens at the Australian "Elite" Summit, which aims to stimulate innovative political thinking for the future.After his election last November put an end to almost twelve years of Conservative Party rule, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd began organizing the "2020 Summit", which aims to stimulate innovative thinking.The theme of the summit is "Aim Big", but prior to the meeting's opening at Parliament House, it was instead Blanchett's thirteen-day old newborn son Ignatius that attracted all the attention.Thirty-eight-year-old Blanchett and her baby appeared glowing as they were photographed together. The baby has also inherited its mother's ability to steal the spotlight and became the focal point for attention at the scene of the event.Also participating in the summit was Hollywood star Hugh Jackman. He praised Blanchett for her determination to participate in the event so soon after delivering her baby.Blanchett will coordinate the creative arts segment of the summit.Jackman said,"Kate Blanchett is a superwoman......she astounds at every level. I think she's a person without fault. I am also extremely happy that we can have her come to lead us."On the 15th, Kevin Rudd went to the hospital in Sydney to visit Blanchett to ask her if she was still able to participate in the summit. He said, however, that she was very insistent that she wanted to participate.
