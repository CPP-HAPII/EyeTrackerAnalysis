April 27, 2008An Indian genome sequencing report recently released by the Indian Department of Science and Technology indicates that the genes of Indians vary greatly, and that among India's various ethnicities, there exists a high degree of genetic differentiation.This research was completed after long-term investigations conducted by more than 150 scientists and research personnel in India. The subjects of study included Indians from four main language families within India's borders: the South Asian language family, the Tibetan-Burmese language family, the Indo-European language family, and the Dravidian language family.The research also indicated that although the degree of genetic differentiation among Indians was quite high, still, Indians universally lack a kind of genetic marker that is resistant to the human AIDS virus HIV-1. It is possible that this causes Indians to have a higher risk of contracting the AIDS virus. (Li Baodong)
