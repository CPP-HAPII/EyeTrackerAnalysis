Yun Mo (Beijing lawyer) January 13, 2007As an important platform for protecting the rights of proprietors, a proprietor committee should actually be an organ that executes the resolutions of proprietor general meetings and represents the interests of proprietors. However, in the year 2006 that went past, proprietor committees came under unprecedented suspicion: some proprietor committee directors were removed from office, some were loathed by proprietors due to internal strife, and others simply resigned.There were also some proprietors who "supported" their current properties and set up "organizing committees" and "supervision committees" to oppose the proprietor committees, and so on.Experts are calling for refining relevant laws and regulations to guarantee that the proprietors have "autonomous management."(Based on a report by Beijing News)When all kinds of disputes or estrangements occur in small neighborhood districts, one inevitable thing is that the current district management model leaves a rather small room for people with different opinions to express and fight for their interests, causing them to often adopt some "unconventional" means in solving the problems.For instance, there are proprietor committees that complain that some proprietors oppose the proprietor committees from reselecting properties because they enjoy special benefits from the original properties. In a certain sense, although these vested interests harm the interests of other proprietors, when these proprietors try hard to protect their own interests in a situation where the facts are not very clear, it is also an expression of rights they are entitled to.Although the method of them setting up "organizing committees" by themselves is not legally recognized, but if we look at this from another perspective, it is not necessarily impossible to see it as an organization or group that is used to express the opinions of a particular "small collective unit."Looking at the typical autonomous district management system, it actually shows a management model similar to a "pyramid."For instance, at the top of the authority is, of course, the proprietor general meeting, and at the base of the pyramid are the individual proprietors. The "pyramid body" between the two can include various main bodies or communities that can either be legally recognized proprietor committees, some proprietors or district proprietor general meetings (conferences) located in a single building or a certain district, also such positions as "head of building" of a particular building or even a particular floor.These multiple and orderly management levels are not only able to resolve some local problems on a timely basis, they can also give the various interest groups more opportunities to express their opinions.As it progresses, it is possible to establish mechanisms that are decided by some proprietors and that can become effective right after being approved by the proprietor committee when they do not harm the overall interests of the district, including public expenses "that are borne by those who benefit."For instance, the laws of some developed countries state that if the spending of a certain public expense can only benefit some proprietors, these proprietors should split this public expense among themselves; if a certain management affair only concerns a part of the common facility, the relevant resolution rules can be stipulated only in the agreement of proprietors who use that part of the facility; and so on.This shows that district management is indeed an art. It requires stressing a kind of "delicate" spirit and art.It is so specific to the action that some proprietors set up an organization to "oppose" the proprietor committees. Actually, if we can first satisfy the interests of most proprietors in the district before giving them an appropriate place in the overall district management framework, or even form a competitive situation like in an autonomous organization with "ruling party" and "opposition party," while at the same time facilitating fair negotiation and dialogues between both parties and supervise the balance mechanism, it will probably be more helpful in promoting community democracy, finally turning this into a "good thing."
