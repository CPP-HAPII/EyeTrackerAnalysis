Zhang Jianping, squad leader of the second company of a brigade in Lanzhou Military Area Command (Source: PLA Daily 3rd edition, Dispatch time: January 6, 2007 06:27)All soldiers had stood sentry. Everyone has a deep impression of the scene of his first sentry duty.However, my first sentry duty was different from others'.Why was it so?It is somewhat shameful when talk about it. My first sentry post was a very special place - restroom.The barrack zone of our brigade was built at the foot of the mountain. At that time, there were only a few aqua privies. No drains were laid so we had to clean out the dung regularly.It happened that our company was the closest to the restroom in the east, thus maintaining the restroom sanitation became our company's 'glorious and tough' duty.When I first arrived at the company, I had 'opinion' about this matter. How could it be so backward in such age!Therefore, every time new comrades-in-arms all vied with each other to clean the restroom, I did not act enthusiastically.Shortly after, the brigade notified us that a chief would come to inspect our work soon and asked our company to make sure that the restroom was clean.On that day, we did an unannounced cleaning. The company also decided to send a 'secret sentry' to safeguard the cleanliness of the restroom and only allowed people to use the restroom at certain time.What was more abominable was that the job actually 'befell' me. Since I was normally bold and outspoken, the company thus decided to make me serve as this 'villain'.Despite my discontent, my sense of responsibility was rather strong. Therefore, I stood in front of the restroom like a small poplar.However, when the company commander saw this, he said that it would not work and that I needed to stand 'secret sentry' to avoid letting the chief know that we set up sentry here intentionally.I had no choice but to pick up a broom and pretended to clean the restroom.The chief did not come on the first day.Early the second day, after the comrades-in-arms finished cleaning the restroom, I got into the 'sentry post' again.Soon afterwards, a middle-aged man in sportswear entered the restroom.I judged by my intuition that this was a family member who came to visit relative in the troops. Therefore, I quickly accosted him and said, "Sir, I am sorry but you cannot use the restroom today." The middle-aged man was dumbfounded, "How come?" "The senior officers will conduct an inspection here so our company has a rule that it can only be used after the inspection.""So you are standing special sentry here?" Once he brought up this subject, I suddenly became angry, "Exactly. I bet you haven't seen my type of sentry before.You see, this restroom does not have drain. Since the leaders are coming to inspect, the company then set a specific time for us to go to the restroom together." The middle-aged man finished listening to my gripe patiently. He cooperated with my job greatly and turned to leave.After breakfast, the messenger Xiao Li suddenly came to inform me to 'pull out from sentry'. He looked at me sympathetically, "You are so muddle-headed. Why didn't you let the brigade commander use the restroom this morning?"My goodness, the middle-aged man turned out to be the brigade commander!I was so afraid that I rushed to find the company commander to admit my mistake.To my surprise, the company commander did not criticize me but said that his work method was off base instead. He added that the brigade commander praised me; the 'restroom sentry', in the phone.Even though my first sentry experience was rather disgraceful, our restroom renovation work actually began a few days later!(sorted by You Chengfeng)Editor's note■Ou CanFortunately, this 'muddle-headed' restroom sentry had reflected the situation to 'Mr. Brigade Commander', otherwise, not only would the renovation not happen to the restroom, the thinking of making symbolic gestures of some cadres would not be reformed either.This incident at least told us three laws: First, senior officers paying calls to the officers and men must perform their duties in a committed manner and understand the situation in order to relieve impediments and ease worries for the officers and men; second, troop commanders should serve as good first teachers for new soldiers and never allow bad practices to spread in the army camp; third, new comrades-in-arms should have the courage to uphold correct opinions and use their élan to counterbalance the lethargy of individual old comrades.
