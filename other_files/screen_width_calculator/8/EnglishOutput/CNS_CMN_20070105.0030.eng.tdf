January 5, 2007, 17:18On December 25 fifteen years ago, the red flag that was printed with a sickle and hammer on top of the Kremlin Palace was slowly lowered amid the rustling, cold wind.It was a declaration to global citizens that a super power - the Soviet Union - had arrived at its final days. It also symbolized the official conclusion of the Cold War that had influenced global structure since the Second World War.In the 70s of the last century, regardless of whether it was socialism or capitalism, economic development encountered a bottleneck.At that time, Western capitalist countries took the lead in undertaking self-reflection, and injected larger doses of market factors into their economies in order to rescue the economies. But since the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe stuck to their old models, their economies finally collapsed, and this in turn led to social unrest.Whereas at that time, China attempted to reform its old system by boldly yet cautiously introducing a market economy. This eventually brought a new life to its troubled national economy.[1]
