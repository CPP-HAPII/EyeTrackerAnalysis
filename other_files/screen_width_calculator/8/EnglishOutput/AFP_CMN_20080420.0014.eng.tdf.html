Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (AFP), 19th.Today, American Democratic Party presidential nominees, Obama and Hillary Clinton, rode planes, trains and automobiles from place to place in Pennsylvania state as part of their last sprint in three days before the key Pennsylvania state primary.Hillary's hope to enter the White House is becoming more and more uncertain and a newly published national poll was another blow for her. On the 22nd, before the Pennsylvania primary, the two nominees vigorously held rallies to try and grab more votes.At her first event, held in a firehouse in West Chester, outside Philadelphia, Hillary indirectly criticized Obama.With a crowd of about 400 people bathing in spring sunshine, Hillary stood in front of the U.S. flag and a fire truck and said: "This is such an important election.I didn't wish to just show up to give a speech that other people don't care about to ignite everybody's momentary passion. I want everybody to really think about what it is we have to do."Obama's camp attacked Hillary's principal political view - health insurance.They put out a new advertising campaign saying Hillary's plan would force people to buy insurance, even if it burdens people that cannot afford it.In York, Hillary struck back saying: "He doesn't go to solve the problem but instead attacks my solution."This is the third stop of her 5 rally activities today.Newsweek's newest opinion poll shows that although a busy month has passed, Obama already leads Hillary in the hearts of Democratic Party voters nationwide.Of the country's Democratic Party members and those that lean towards the Democratic Party, 54 percent support Obama, leading Hillary's 35 percent by a wide margin.
