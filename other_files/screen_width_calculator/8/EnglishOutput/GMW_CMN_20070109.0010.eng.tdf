Li Hongqiang 2007-01-09By calling academic historical lectures given by scholars such as Yan Chongnian and Yi Zhongtian "history-telling," we seem to be guilty of comparing them with the "storytelling" of masters like Lian Kuoru, Shan Tianfang, and Liu Lanfang.Of course, the distinction is very obvious. For instance, the former refers to basically history, whereas the latter refers to literary works such as "Outlaws of the Marsh," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "The Legend of Yue Fei," and "The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants."Also, the latter is essentially dramatic representations of manuscripts from earlier generations, whereas the former encompasses creation, with ownership of a flurry of copyrighted publications.However, it would be somewhat arbitrary if these alone are used to conclude that academics are in their own lofty class.As a matter of fact, academic historical lectures given by these academics borrow the literary techniques of storytellers, and have transformed the orthodox interpretations of "official history" to a storytelling-like level of "history-telling." To continue using the label "official narration" of history may give more credit than what is deserved.The 1980s were a golden era for storytellers.Changes in the times and a hunger for literature were, without a doubt, important pretexts for their rise.The literary technique used by storytellers in dramatic narration of fictional source materials was also an important success factor.On the one hand, they revived ancient literary works that were the most dramatic and richest in folklore.On the other hand, storytellers used entirely colloquial language in acting out characters and simulating stories, performing for listeners the hustle and bustle of all aspects of life.Third is the integration of historic novels with legends and unofficial history. The original novels are after all fictional, so it does not really matter if some nonsense is thrown in.Today, twenty years later, academics who give history lectures are making grand appearances.The only thing is, the media on which they rely has changed from radio, which storytellers used, to television. What's more, it is CCTV, whose broadcast coverage is unmatched. Meanwhile, the content of the lectures is not pure fiction, chivalrous swordsmen and flying celestial beings, but rather heroes in troubled times, emperors, generals, and ministers who are even more imposing and exciting than chivalrous swordsmen and flying celestial beings.In the 45-minute period fixed by the television station, the lecturer uses the period like an episode of a television series. The standard introduction, climax, developments, transitions, and conclusion are all meticulously put together.While this is a dramatic televised performance by the lecturer, it also relies on "suspenseful" plots and points to "decipher," which are chosen by the lecturer.For example, in "True Stories of the 12 Qing Emperors" and "Savoring the Three Kingdoms," one or more mysteries are selected for each segment of the lecture. Listening to the academics' lectures is like watching Agatha Christie's "Murder on the Orient Express."As a result, interpretations of "official history" contain a distinct dramatic component.It must be pointed out that interpretations of "official history" by academics who lecture on television are not confined by official historical materials.Actually, the focus points of their lectures are like magnets, attracting various kinds of material from official history, unofficial history, and folklore.Though the conclusion may be accurate, with people gaining a clearer understanding to a certain extent, the piecing together, affirmation, and rebuttal of various kinds of historical material during their lectures make you believe that a bizarre literary narration is given a stage here to perform. It is as if we are reading novels by some avant-garde writers from the 1980s, with this reading like achieving a discovery of endless possibilities.Of course, unlike academics who are only concerned about accurate conclusions, avant-garde novels are more concerned with just the process.In an age of promoting traditional culture, re-understanding history is no doubt a kind of advancement, and is also an important basis for traditional culture entering modern life.But in the end, is "history-telling," which has become a vogue and especially focuses on the process of sensationalism, using literature to turn history into entertainment, or is it really clarifying history?The more important question is: what kind of history can such "history-telling" tell you?It is common for cautious researchers or writers relying on imagination to use a principle of "making the past serve the present" in choosing topics.Of course, compared with those purely entertaining "costume comedies," "making the past serve the present" is indeed a big step forward.However, today's "history-telling" trend is being dominated by a "making the past serve the present" focus, which makes people worried.In the fluid narration of "Savoring the Three Kingdoms," which is a combination of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms," what stands out is the practical ethics and materialistic choices reflected in the historical figures' actions.As described by Eryuehe, writer of the original script, the television series "Red Cap Businessman Hu Xueyan" strives to give prominence to the "sincerity, righteousness, resourcefulness, and boldness" of the "hero," thereby providing a textbook for present-day businesspeople.However, with this kind of concept, it seems that things always go contrary to intentions."Red Cap Businessman Hu Xueyan" makes present-day businesspeople, and even ordinary people, pay attention to his "success" -- that kind of clever collusion between officials and merchants!Others such as "Qiao's Grand Courtyard," and movies like "The Banquet" and "The City of Golden Armor," invariably cram the materialistic desires of modern people, or the relaxed tone of amusing entertainment, into the original history.These histories emerging amidst the "history-telling" trend, under the theme of "making the past serve the present," and by borrowing literary techniques, are being traced too identically!Actually, works like "The Historian" and "The Da Vinci Code" that truly use literary techniques to explore historical clues offer great inspiration, both for our academic historical lectures and for creation of historical literature.Our works often use many written or spoken words to introduce the features and customs of ancient eras, which on the surface seems like a painstaking effort to "recreate historical scenes."However, when it comes to disclosing purpose and bringing forth emotion, the face of a modern person, filled with desire, flashes forth.They come in a straightforward manner, directly cutting in from where modern people are, beginning an exploration of history from historical materials discovered by modern people. Using historical material as a guide, other paths emerge from the fog of history presented by the succession of historical materials.From this, we see another constantly flowing historical river, which moreover, is a river that is unknown and startling to the eye.Differing from our artificial recreation of "historical scenes," instead of creating an ancient atmosphere they start from the "opposite direction," searching from past to present bit by bit, slowly unlocking secrets and presenting readers with a history that is both intellectual and humanistic.In contrast, our popular "history-telling" vogue had long ago caused quiet contemplation to give way to entertainment and material gain.
