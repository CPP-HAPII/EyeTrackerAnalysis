For many years they have always paid attention to and supported Guangxi's business development, have done lots of work in promoting Guangxi, and have made positive contributions for raising Guangxi's popularity and openness.Liu Qibao also briefly introduced to his guests the situations of Guangxi's economic and social development, as well as the radio and television broadcasting industry.He said that, in recent years, Guangxi's various enterprises have made great progress, the economy and society develop fast, and open cooperation has deepened unceasingly. With the advancement of "one axis, two wings," the new regional cooperative pattern with ASEAN countries, Guangxi, from a relatively sealed outlying provincial region, is progressively becoming an open front, a focal point of multi-regional cooperation.Guangxi's geographical advantages are showing up, its development environment and conditions have made unprecedented improvement.Guangxi's radio and television broadcasting industry has also progressed greatly. The integration of network resources and the works of availability of radio and television broadcasting to "every village" in the countryside are all in the first ranks of the country.Liu Qibao said that in these last few days, the top central news media are being focused on reporting on the openness and development of Beibu Gulf (Guangxi) Economic Zone and the situation of pan-Beibu Gulf regional economic cooperation. This will certainly further raise Guangxi's status and facilitate Guangxi's development.Phoenix TV has not only built up a communication bridge between the motherland of Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, but also has widespread influence among Chinese people around the whole world. We welcome Phoenix TV to carry out business cooperation with Guangxi's media, and hope Phoenix TV will continue to pay warm attention to and promote Guangxi, especially the openness and development of Beibu Gulf (Guangxi) Economic Zone and the situation of pan-Beibu Gulf regional economic cooperation, so as to let people know more about Guangxi, understand Guangxi, and promote Guangxi's openness and cooperation, as well as its social and economic development.Liu Changle thanked Liu Qibao for the meeting.He said that Guangxi's huge change in recent years and the Guangxi people's enterprising spirit have left deep impressions on him.He expressed that Phoenix TV will further strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Guangxi's radio and television media, pay more attention to Guangxi, and better promote Guangxi.It was reported that Liu Changle's visit to Guangxi was mainly concerned with further discussing with relevant autonomous region departments about the large-scale radio and television broadcasting interview activities related to the jointly sponsored "China   ASEAN Cooperation Tour."Shen Beihai, Director of the Propaganda Department, and Che Rongfu, Secretary General of the Autonomous Region's Party Committee members, also attended the meeting.(Jiang Lin)
