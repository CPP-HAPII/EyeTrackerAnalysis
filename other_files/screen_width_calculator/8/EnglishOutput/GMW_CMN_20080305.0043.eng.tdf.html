Staff Reporters Fu Xiaoyue and Li Ke, 2008-03-05In front of a large photo of a "Lei Feng Vehicle" driver at work with a smile on her face, Beijing resident Li Suzhen, who hurried here specially from the North Ring Road #5, stood still for a long time and could not help removing her glasses to wipe tears from her eyes."The photographs from the 'Lei Feng Vehicle' deeds have brought back a lot of my memories. Lianyungang has established itself as a role model for the whole country. When the economy has risen, spiritual civilization also must follow.Such is the spirit of Lei Feng: to nurture a magnanimous sentiment in one's ordinary work!"On March 4, on the eve of the 45th anniversary of the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's inscription "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," the "Flag of Civilization: A Photo Exhibition of Lianyungang's 'Lei Feng Vehicle' Deeds," held in the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution by the municipal party committee and government of Lianyungang of Jiangsu Province, moved people in the capital city.The name "Lei Feng Vehicle" was born in 1963. The protagonists of the story were the women members of the long-distance service crew at Xinpu central bus station in Lianyungang, Jiangsu.In addition to diligently and wholeheartedly performing their duties, twice daily they pulled "Lei Feng Vehicle," rain or shine, in both hot and cold weathers, for 365 days out of the year, in a volunteer effort to serve travelers from all over the country who were in need of help. Ever since it started, the service has been going on for 45 years.With 9 changes of vehicles and 8 changes in the persons who pulled them, the vehicles evolved from human-drawn carts, to tricycles to the current electric tourist vehicles. They have covered more than 70,000 kilometers, the equivalent of circling the earth two times, and the "Lei Feng Vehicle" spirit of "preferring to endure numerous hardships themselves than allow passengers to suffer inconvenience at the moment" has stayed the same all along.A few generations of "Lei Feng Vehicle" drivers, who have come to the capital along with the exhibition, have become focal points of the exhibition hall.Standing in front of a group photograph of her and her female colleagues from 44 years ago, 66-year-old first-generation driver Li Baoying, surrounded by spectators, spoke of those years: "In 1963, Chairman Mao put out the call to "Learn from Lei Feng." We found that it was very inconvenient for travelers to transfer between the bus station to the train station. So with a little carrying pole and a rope, we went to the train station to deliver and pick up passengers and carry their luggage for free."Second-generation "Lei Feng Vehicle" driver Xu Mei, a former elected deputy to the Seventh National People's Congress, was pointing at a steel hand cart in the photograph as she slipped into a deep recollection: "At the time, I was a young woman pulling a steel hand cart; I never felt it was a chore, my heart was warm with the feeling of being able to serve the people the same as Lei Feng did."In front of a photograph of a dying old "Lei Feng Vehicle" driver entrusting her daughter to the "Lei Feng Vehicle" team, the edges of Xiao Yan's eyes reddened.Xiao Yan, who was that girl being entrusted, later became a third-generation "Lei Feng Vehicle" driver."Walking my mom's path, being a person like Lei Feng, passing the "Lei Feng Vehicle" spirit down through the generations!" she said."This time the exhibition has come to Beijing in the hopes it can give a concentrated display of the historical processes of birth, growth, and refinement of the "Lei Feng Vehicle," this national advanced example of spiritual civilization, as well as give a concentrated display of Lianyungang Municipality's impressive efforts to raise the quality of city residents, promote scientific advancement, take the lead in development, make progress by leaps and bounds, and develop in a harmonious way through building a stronger spiritual civilization, "introduced Lianyungang Municipal Party Committee Secretary Wang Jianhua.Indeed, the spirit is interlinked.The campaign entitled "Study the spirit of the 'Lei Feng Vehicle;' travel the road of the 'Lei Feng Vehicle'" is currently in full swing in Lianyungang. The "Lei Feng Vehicle" deeds, having already become shining trademarks of Lianyungang's urban civilization, have now moved the nation's capital as well.Du Zhenzhong, who hurried over from Miyun, was so absorbed in viewing the exhibits that he missed lunch: "Maybe common people can't accomplish anything earth-shaking, but studying Lei Feng you want to begin with little things close to you.I'll bring my child here for another visit in a day or two!""Learning from Lei Feng's good example, be loyal to the Revolution, loyal to the Party!..." In the exhibition hall, two-year-old Qin Jiaze hummed along with his grandmother, causing many people to join in softly. (Staff Report from Beijing, March 4)
