According to Gao Peiyong, deputy director of the Financial, Trade and Economic Research Institute of the China Academy of Social Sciences, the promotion of VAT reform throughout the country signifies a crucial step has been taken in the new round of reform of the Chinese tax system.As a kind of circulation tax, value-added tax is intended to levy tax on the newly increased value of enterprises rather than on the purchased value.But what is applied by China is a production-based value-added tax. Compared with the consumption-based value-added tax used extensively throughout the world, it does not allow enterprises to deduct purchased fixed assets. Therefore, the tax base of the value-added tax is larger than the GDP. The tax imposed is on revenues that are not part of the added value of enterprises, so that it has become a tax category that does not live up to its name.In an interview with a reporter of Xinhua News Agency, Jia Kang, NPPCC member and director of the Financial Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Finance, said that it is high time that the reform of the value-added tax was spread throughout the country. The transformation of value-added tax is, in fact, designed to reduce the burden on enterprises and encourage them to update their equipment and upgrade their technology, which will help enhance their overall competitiveness.The reform of the value-added tax is aimed at transformation-from a production-based to a consumption-based tax.The "11th Five-Year Plan" explicitly calls for "nationwide completion of transformation from production-based to consumption-based value-added tax" in the 2006-2010 period.As a reform designed to reduce the burden on taxpayers, the reform of the value-added tax was initiated on a trial basis in eight industries in "three provinces and one municipality" in the Northeast starting from July 2004. Then, in July 2007, the reform was extended to 26 cities in six central provinces for further experimentation aimed at accumulating experience for the nationwide implementation of the reform.Gao Peiyong told the reporter that the shift from a production-based to a consumption-based value-added tax is manifested primarily in the shrinkage of the VAT base. The main details involve allowing deduction of the input VAT on the fixed assets purchased by enterprises, including machines and devices, from the output VAT.An Tifu, vice president of China Institute of Taxation, noted that the steady promotion of VAT reform throughout the country will enable avoiding double taxation and minimization the distortion of the market mechanism caused by taxation.Ai Hongde, NPC deputy and president of Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, said VAT reform will help reduce the non-neutral effect of taxation on the normal investment conduct of enterprises, increase their cash flow, improve their enthusiasm for investment in equipment and technical transformation and strengthen their capability for self-development.In the meantime, the reform has also strongly boosted industrial restructuring and change of the mode of economic growth in the regions of the experimentation, thus accumulating precious experience for the further promotion of the reform in the future.
