Li Qiang, our special correspondent Ma Shengwei (Source: China's National Defense News, issue time: 2007-01-09 08:51)On October 16, 2006, PLA University of Science and Technology Communication Engineering Institute Associate Professor Shen Pinglin's daughter Shen Yang won the 23rd Women's World Chess Junior Championship.People all say that not only is Shen Yang the Chinese people's pride; she is also a Chinese military family's pride.Growing-up: Cultivating the moral character of a servicemanBorn in a military family, Shen Yang learned to be independent since childhood.Her father was a backbone faculty member for the school's education and research, and was usually busy running between the laboratory and the classroom; therefore, he had very little time to look after Shen Yang. Although a doctor, her mother devoted nearly all her loving concerns to her patients.At the age of just one year and a half, Shen Yang had already entered kindergarten.Every day, lying prone on her father's shoulder, little Shen Yang looked curiously at the students passing in front of her in neatly formed ranks, and listened to their resonant songs near her ears.Perhaps it was from then on that many characteristics of the military soldiers had already left deep impressions on little Shen Yang's mind.In 1996, Shen Yang began to learn chess.She studied very earnestly, very devotedly.Every day throughout the year, her father took her on a bicycle and rushed between the family and the chess school, regardless of weather and seasons.Once, exactly when it was training time, Shen Yang had a foot ossiculum bone fracture.Her father purposefully intended to test her, saying: "I will ask for leave for you and you don't need to go to participate in the training." However, Shen Yang insisted firmly on her father taking her to the chess school.Even Shen Pinglin, who had always been strict with Shen Yang, couldn't help but feel impressed. He didn't expect the daughter to really have such tenacity.Therefore, her father helped Shen Yang apply some medicine and wrap up, then put Shen Yang on the bike and set off.During her 10-year involvement with chess, Shen Yang stayed home less, stayed outside more, rested less, trained more, but though little in age she never complained.Her teacher and fellow chess players all said that inside Shen Yang there existed a kind of military moral character!Whetting: Forging a military attitudeSitting by the chess table, the calmness and composure Shen Yang displayed often made her opponents feel at awe.The famous Russian male chess player Morozevich, when talking about the Chinese female chess players, appraised Shen Yang very highly.While Shen Yang was still of a very small age, her father had cautioned her against arrogance and delicateness, and had advised that she should dare to challenge any difficulties.This kind of hale and hearty military attitude accompanied her on all battles in the chess field.In 2003, Shen Yang went from Nanjing to Beijing all alone to learn from the masters, and obtained 3rd rank in the national chess tournament team competition for the Jiangsu women's team.She returned to Nanjing from Beijing at a time when school was just going to have final examinations.Taking the exams or not?The school's suggestion was that Shen Yang had returned with honors; therefore, she was worthy of special considerations.Shen Yang did not assume privileges.After a short preparation, she participated in the examination and even took the 1st rank of the entire grade.In 2004, during the last round of Individual Competition against a Lebanese Asian Female, so long as Shen Yang ended in a draw she would surely have taken the first place.Yet she made some fatal moves while she was in an advantageous situation, thus missed the championship.Facing the setback, she said with a smile: this is a required course in growing up.In 2005 while attending a world group tournament, she was the last to finish the last chess round among all those present.At that time, the entire competition was already near the end, the awards ceremony was already all well prepared and ready, just waiting for Shen Yang to finish her round and it would commence immediately.But before this, due to a small mistake, Shen Yang was in a quite disadvantageous situation.In front of all the spectators and various referees, Shen Yang kept her composure, finally defeated her opponent.Confrontation: Showing the military styleFrom the time when she first participated in the "Li Chengzhi" Cup National Children's Chess Championship in 1998, every year Shen Yang had to attend at least two large-scale domestic and international competitions.She was always seeking an opponent.From the national team's teammates to the various countries' top players, from Indian female grandmaster Aarthie Ramaswamy to Rublevsky, Shen Yang was always calm in each and every battle, as she was already used to attacking and defending in the 64 squares of the chess battleground.In 2000, at the national children's championship in Huangshi, Hubei, during the last round, if Shen Yang won the round, she would be in second place. If she ended up in a draw, she would be 5th. However, if she lost, she would be 7th, whereas her opponent would be 1st as long as the match ended in a draw.Her opponent proposed a draw several times, but Shen Yang did not agree.When Shen Yang finally won the match, she did not celebrate the victory, but ran up to comfort her opponent.In the 23rd International Female Chess Tournament, Shen Yang's road to the championship could be described as full of twists and turns, with the first few rounds going on smoothly.During the middle stage of the competition, Shen Yang encountered trouble, and lost the 6th and 9th round to Mongolian chess player Mongontuul and Georgian chess player Purtseladze, respectively.She suddenly found herself with a one-and-a-half point gap to first place.During the most crucial final 4 rounds of competitions, Shen Yang withstood the pressure, made her movements skillfully against the opponents, and successfully won the championship by 3 wins and 1 draw.When the competition ended, all the people on the spot stood up to applaud her, not only for her excellent skills, but also for her composure and her tenacity!
