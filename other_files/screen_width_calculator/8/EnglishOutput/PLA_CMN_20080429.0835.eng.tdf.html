When you look to the land on a helicopter, all types of things can be seen from a panoramic view. Everything can be seen.If one's thoughts were just like a helicopter, one could observe things and identify problems from different elevations and different viewpoints, its results would inevitably be more objective and accurate. The benefits are self-evident.Usually, quite a few of us like to judge things according to habitual thinking or our familiar ways, then make a decision. If we don't consider right or wrong, merely in the process alone we can find their thoughts are not open and insights are not far and long, so hands and feet are naturally bound.If things continue this way, while working, we can only observe rules and regulations and keep to convention. In a today in which new things and new issues endlessly spring up, this becomes a big obstacle for innovation and advancement."Helicopter thinking" is actually a way of expressing innovative thought.The modern era is an era of innovation and change. One's way of thinking often determines the success or failure of undertakings.Just like an advertisement said: The stage is as big as the heart is;the road goes as far as the heart goes.At work we might as well have a bit more "helicopter thinking" to make ourselves stand higher and see further.
