Wang Kun (Xinhua News Agency Correspondent) 2007-01-01Small coal mines with insufficient production capacity, diminishing resources, backward equipment, or serious hidden safety hazards should be shut down immediately according to the law. Yet, after being elaborately appraised and dressed up by intermediary agencies, they become coal mines in conformance with industrial policies overnight.These problem coal mines, which should be eliminated but continue to exist, have created one shocking mine disaster after another.Nanshan Coal Mine in Lingshi County, Shanxi Province, where an accident resulted in 34 deaths, was a typical example of this.This small coal mine with diminishing resources escaped the fate of being shut down after the coal mine owner lobbied extensively for a fraudulent appraisal, in which annual production capacity was abruptly changed from 30,000 tons to 90,000 tons.This kind of small illegal coal mine surviving by means of fraudulent appraisal does not exist only in Shanxi. There are quite a number of them in other places too.At present, the serious practice of fraudulent appraisals in the mining industry shows that some intermediary agencies, consumed with desire for profits, completely go against laws and public morality to become accomplices to lawbreaking mine owners.If problems only existed within intermediary agencies themselves, then things would not be so worrisome. But relevant government departments neglect the pre-incident supervision of intermediary agencies and rarely carry out their post-incident responsibilities.More serious is that some intermediary agencies have "powerful backing" since their dates of "birth," with close connections to some individuals in supervisory departments. They not only can go through multiple levels of review and approval to smoothly set up businesses despite "a lack of key components," but can also enjoy special treatment from many sides while carrying out illegal business operations, repeatedly escaping supervision and penalties.In addition, with some small mines fraudulently reporting production capacity to escape being shut down, they fulfill the persistent desire of local governments to meet GDP targets. If the fraudulent practices of intermediary agencies happen to get the results which local government leaders want, what is there against it?The fraudulent practices of intermediary agencies in mineral resource and safety appraisals have become a major reason for frequent accidents in these high-risk industries.The harm in an intermediary agency's fraud is that cloaked in fairness and neutrality, it is bent on only making profits and plays a role in covering up hidden safety hazards.As a result of this, the relevant Shanxi Province department recently decided to reject the participation of intermediary agencies in reappraising coal mines with production capacity of 90,000 tons.However, this is obviously not a long-term measure.The existence of intermediary agencies is necessary. The issue is whether their review, approval, and supervision are strictly enforced.
