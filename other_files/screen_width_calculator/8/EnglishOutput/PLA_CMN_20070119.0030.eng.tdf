Lu Xusheng and Special Staff Correspondent Cheng Wenxiang (Source: PLA Daily, Page 2, Time of Release: 2007-01-19 06:13)In the winter's third nine-day period, cold wind was piercing the bone.Wang Yuyang, who has received a retirement directive, decided to pay one more medical visit to folks in the area where the unit is stationed.This writer went with him upon hearing the news.Wang Yuyang was formerly director of a clinic in a certain Beijing Military Command unit. The army unit is stationed in a well-known impoverished mountain area in northern Hebei.Over these past years, from starting as an ordinary military doctor to serving as director of the clinic, he never changed his habit of using holidays and weekends to make medical visits.Before the retirement directive was announced, Wang Yuyang had already made a total of 215 medical visits in the area where the unit is stationed, treating more than 10,000 cases and saving more than 200 patients in critical condition.Carrying on his back a medical kit with a red cross, Wang Yuyang crushed the snow as he "crunched" toward Shangshidong Village.We followed behind him, struggling for breath.As soon as we entered the village, villager Fang Haijun ran up to Wang Yuyang, out of breath, saying "Hurry up ... hurry and save my wife...."It turned out that Fang Haijun's wife was in labor at home, with a placental abruption ...Wang Yuyang immediately rushed inside Fang Haijun's home. A series of emergency measures was quickly commenced -- sterilization, stopping the bleeding, giving oxygen, and providing an infusion.When the condition of the woman in labor changed from dangerous to safe, Wang Yuyang wiped sweat from his forehead, and without bothering to drink a sip of water, started for other homes of his old patients in the village.Unexpectedly, a short while later we heard Fang Haijun's urgent shout: "The baby is dying!" Wang Yuyang immediately turned around and ran back.When he determined that the baby was choking on phlegm in its throat, he decisively bent down and gave mouth-to-mouth.In time, the baby uttered a loud cry, and its face slowly turned pink.At this time, Wang Yuyang was coughing himself out of breath.Wang Yuyang never eats meals at the villagers' homes.On this day for lunch, we greatly enjoyed eating together with Wang Yuyang. Each person had two pieces of bread, a jug of water, and a packet of preserved vegetables.On the way back, this writer asked Wang Yuyang whether he was tired. Passionately, he spoke about something that happened in March last year. He was hospitalized for treatment on his neck, and when the people in the area heard about it, 13 villager representatives took a special train trip to visit him.These villagers, who normally went without even meat and eggs, bought cereal, walnut power, and other nutritional supplements.Wang Yuyang said that whenever he thinks of these things, he feels warm at heart.After returning to the unit clinic, Wang Yuyang opened his "medical visit log" and recorded that day's details: Uncle Wang's asthma had not emerged for a week; Granny Li's arthritis did not respond very much to the painkilling cream; and Uncle Zhao's lower back pain was much better than last time...(Staff Report, Shijiazhuang, January 17)
