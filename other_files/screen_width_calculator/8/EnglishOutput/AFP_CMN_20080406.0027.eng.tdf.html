PARIS, 5th (AFP)France's human rights minister Yade denied today that during a media interview she had set three conditions on French President Sarkozy's attendance of the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics.Le Monde had quoted Yade as saying there were three "indispensable" conditions for Sarkozy to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympics, these being "a halt to violent suppression of the people, the release of political prisoners, and settling the state of affairs in Tibet as well as opening talks with Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.But a few hours after Le Monde made public the details of the interview, Yade issued a statement saying she had not used the word "condition".The statement said, "In the same way that I have since the Tibetan crisis erupted, I consistently used precise vocabulary to carefully express France's position. President Sarkozy has said he does not rule out any option. As for the issue of whether he will attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, he will, based on how the situation in Tibet develops, make a statement at an appropriate time."A spokesperson for Le Monde told an inquiring AFP reporter that the paper "faithfully presented Yade's words."
