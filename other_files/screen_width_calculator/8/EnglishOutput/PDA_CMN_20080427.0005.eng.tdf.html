Apr. 27, 2008According to reports in the Paraguayan media on the 26th, the departing Paraguayan President Duarte Frutos has organized "fat jobs" in the customs department for several of his relatives. This has given rise to rebuke from both inside and outside the government.According to a report in ABC-Color, Paraguay's largest circulation newspaper, the head of the Paraguayan Tax Authority signed an order in recent days appointing President Frutos's relative Duarte Guerrero to the post of customs officer at the Guarani International Airport.Earlier, Mariano Duarte and Jaime [Suliente], two relatives of Frutos's wife, were also appointed respectfully as customs coordinator for Paran√° and customs coordinator for Guarani International Airport.These actions by Frutos led to intense criticism for all sides.The opposition party rebuked him for using his power for private gain before he left office.Ruling party members are also unhappy with him and say that these acts will influence party morale, which is already low following the loss in the general election.Paraguay's opposition parties say they will straighten out government agencies after it takes power in August of this year and dismiss these public servants that gained access to jobs in government agencies by virtue of personal ties.Paraguay's general election on the 20th of this month produced a new president and legislature.The party that Frutos leads, the Red Party, lost the election. Fernando Lugo, the 58-year-old presidential candidate of the "Patriotic Alliance for Change", an alliance of opposition parties, beat the ruling party candidate and was elected the new president.
