Kubica is the car racer for the BMW team.According to a report from Poland's "Daily Newspaper" on the 29th, when Stuart was interviewed he said Kubica made him feel shocked. One aspect was his score, and another aspect was that he came from undeveloped car-racing Poland.Stewart said: "To my knowledge, Poland hasn't had any F1 car racers, but now Kubica has become a contender for the championship."Stewart said: "I previously thought Kubica was the most outstanding young F1 car racer, of course +after that the even more outstanding Hamilton appeared."But he said that it was beyond his ability to describe this season's outstanding performance by Kubica and the BMW team.Stewart said he was not surprised that the BMW team could grow to be the best team because BMW is one of the world's biggest car manufacturers, with strong and solid hardware and they also prepare their tactics thoroughly.He said what surprised him was the BMW team's rate of advancement. Being able to get into the top three teams within such a short time is really a miracle.Stewart said the BMW team will undoubtedly become the "lion on the path" for the Ferrari team's road to the championship. They may some day force their way to the world championship.But he said that this race season's BMW team still isn't mature enough. Next race season they will inevitably make a lot of trouble for the Ferrari team. (The End)2008/04/29 18:48
