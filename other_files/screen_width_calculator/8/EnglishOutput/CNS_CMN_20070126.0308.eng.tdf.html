January 26, 2007, 11:10Chinanews.com, January 26 - Venezuelan President Chavez warned US Ambassador to Venezuela Brownfield on Thursday (the 25th) that if further indiscreet criticisms about the nationalization of CANTV were made, he'd be expelled by the Venezuelan government for meddling with Venezuela's internal affairs.Chavez said, "If you continue to meddle in Venezuela's internal affairs, you will be declared persona non grata, and will have to leave Venezuela."Earlier on Thursday, Brownfield said that the nationalization of CANTV must be carried out "in a transparent and legal way," and that the Venezuelan government must "give fair compensation to shareholders who had suffered losses," calling this "the responsibility of the government."CANTV is the largest telecom operator in Venezuela and was privatized in 1991. US telecom operator Verizon Communications Inc.owns 28.5% of its shares and is its largest shareholder.According to Chavez's plan, CANTV will be nationalized very soon, and it will not compensate shareholders who had suffered losses.(Zhong Yan)
