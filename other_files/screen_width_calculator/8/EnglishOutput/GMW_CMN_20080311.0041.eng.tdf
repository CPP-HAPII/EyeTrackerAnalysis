2008-03-11March 10th, U.S. New York State Governor, Democratic Party member Elliot Spitzer (right), and his wife attended a news conference in New York.That day, Spitzer held an emergency news conference to apologize to his family and the public for his involvement in a sex deal incident.Spitzer immediately faced pressure to resign.Xinhua News Agency/ ReutersThe involvement of U.S. Democratic Party member and New York Governor Spitzer in the prostitution incident was a shock to New York politics. Although Spitzer publicly apologized, he did not resign.Compared to the somewhat gentler attitude of his own party members, the opposition party seemingly didn't let him off the hook. They think Spitzer, who had a high opinion of himself and had lofty moral demands, must resign to show responsibility.This is Spitzer's first term. He was previously New York State's Attorney General, establishing his career by attacking business corruption with all his strength. After the prostitution incident came out, although he publicly apologized, his image has already been greatly harmed.New York Republican Federal congressman from the Long Island electoral district, King, said, "I don't wish to hit a guy when he's down, but Spitzer believes himself to have very high morals and is unforgiving. He must step down, nobody will stand with him."New York State Assembly Republican legislator Tedisco also demanded that Spitzer immediately resign.He said, "Spitzer is already incapable of assuming public office anymore and is also incapable of leading New York State."In contrast to the opposition party's calls for an immediate resignation, the tone of comrades of the same party were a bit more gentle.New York State Democratic senator Schumer thinks that even though this event is very bad for Spitzer himself and his family, he doesn't want to say too much before Spitzer tells the story in detail.Democratic presidential contender, Hillary Clinton also didn't want to say too much, except for wishing Spitzer himself and his family well. She also said she wants to observe developments over the next few days before saying anything.The same party's former New York State governor Cuomo said "this is an extremely cruel tragedy for the governor himself, his family and the rest of society."New York State senate republican leader, Bruno also said "For the people of New York state, the people in office should do the right thing, let state affairs can be carried out normally and use the budget for the most suitable purposes."Democratic New Jersey governor Corzine said these are very grave and disturbing accusations.Spitzer must regain the confidence of his family and the public.
