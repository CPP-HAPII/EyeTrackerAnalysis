(Source: PLA Daily 4th edition, Dispatch time: January 28, 2007 06:39)Staff Reporter, Xi'an, January 27, Xu Feng, Wei Wen. A special wedding was solemnly held at the Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University at noon today.The first living-donor intestinal transplantation patient in China Yang Feng ushered in happy moments of warmth and romance eight years after his surgery and walked into the wedding hall hand in hand with the bride in the blessings of the guests.The groom Yang Feng, 27, a native of Sanmenxia City, Henan Province, suffered from intestinal obstruction and intestinal necrosis at the age of 18 and was forced to remove his small intestine.After the surgery, Yang Feng's small intestine was less than one tenth of that of a normal person and had difficulty in supporting his life.In March 1999, Yang Feng was admitted to the Gastrointestinal Ward of the Xijing Hospital.At that time, he, who was 1.83 meters tall, only had 35 kilos of weight left and his life was in grave danger.In order to save Yang Feng's life, his father Yang Runsheng asked to donate his own intestine without regret.In order to ensure the success of the surgery, the Xijing Hospital set up a special small intestinal transplantation leading group and an advisory team of 15 experts. They consulted large volume of domestic and overseas materials to enact a careful surgery plan and conducted over 20 successive animal small intestinal transplantation experiments.On May 20 of that year, using the Gastrointestinal Ward as the hub, 23 departments, over 60 experts, professors, and medical staff of the Xijing Hospital coordinated closely to perform simultaneous surgeries on the patient and his father.They overcame various difficulties to first remove father Yang Runsheng's 150-cm-long ileum and joined it with Yang Feng's blood vessels and intestines by anastomosis after lavage. After 10 hours of hard work, our nation's first living-donor small intestinal transplantation surgery was successfully completed.The post-surgery strong rejection was the biggest challenge to the success of small intestinal transplantation.Under the meticulous treatment and care of the medical staff, Yang Feng's body recovered steadily. He weights 60 kilos now and becomes an independent out-patient of the Gastrointestinal Ward.Not only was he the first person to receive living-donor small intestinal transplantation in the country, he is also the longest surviving living-donor small intestinal transplantation patient in Asia.
