In that way, I won't have to meticulously plan every second in order to spend time with my family."Taiwanese student Lin Hsiao-hsi, who is taking an evening chartered flight on the 6th to return to Taipei, took a cross-strait charter flight to the mainland for the first time.She said her dominant feeling regarding the chartered flight was that it was "fast".Lin Hsiao-hsi, who took a short holiday in Shanghai, used the opportunity to see her father, a Taiwanese businessman. "I visited Chenghuang Miao Temple and tried a lot of snacks that are different in flavor from those we have on the island. I also experienced the new Shanghai of the Bund and Xintiandi and how it beautifully combines tradition and fashion.She said, "In the afternoon I was still in Shanghai; in the evening, I was able to return to Taipei; and tomorrow morning will be able to attend classes fully refreshed. It is really unimaginable."She looks forward in the future to being able at pleasure to take a three-hour direct flight to Shanghai.Tung Ta-wei, head representative for China Airlines in Shanghai, told reporters, "Presently, the cross-strait charter flights are still not "direct flights" in the true sense of the term, since they still have to pass through the Hong Kong Flight Information Region."He said that whether it be airline companies or passengers on both sides of the strait, everybody hopes full direct flights can be implemented as soon as possible in order to economize even more on time and money.Hector Yeh, executive vice president of the Association of Taiwan Investment Enterprises on the Mainland and president of Shanghai Long Fong Foods Co. Ltd., told reporters, "I hope the normalization of cross-strait charter flights and even full direct flights can be realized as quickly as possible, the sooner the better."(Reporter: Ren Qinqin)
