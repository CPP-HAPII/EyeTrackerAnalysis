But Fan Fuchun refrained from disclosing the specific content of the opinions and when they were conveyed.Fan Fuchun: Face-to-face communication with the board chairman of Ping'an has occurred.Fan Fuchun explained that whenever circumstances arise, the CSRC will have one of its agencies find the person in charge of the listed company in question to express regulatory opinions in the hope that a speedy response can be made to questions raised by the market.Fan Fuchun said, "This is the CSRC's timely fulfillment of its regulatory responsibilities."Fan Fuchun made these remarks in an interview with the reporter that occurred during a break between group discussions of CPPCC members.Fan Fuchun said that he had communicated face to face with Board Chairman Ma Mingyu of China Ping'an in the hope that China Ping'an can take initiative in communicating with the market, listening to market feedback and responding to market doubts in a timely and down-to-earth manner.Fan Fuchun said that if investors disapprove of something, they can vote with their feet rather than find a referee to make a judgment whenever they have a complaint about a company. The market has its own balancing mechanism.Fan Fuchun revealed that, so far, China Ping'an has not yet submitted its formal application materials to the CSRC.A company that intends to issue shares should first seek a board resolution and adoption by the shareholder's meeting before submitting materials to CSRC.Final approval for China Ping'an by the Issuance Examination Committee is subject to determination by the committee's members pursuant to relevant regulations.There is still no confirmation that the refinancing plan has been included into the annual report.There have been reports that the regulatory authorities are recently contemplating the release of a circular to propose that listed companies should, in accordance with the provisions of annual report regulations, prudently outline and disclose their financing scheme in their annual report, which should be released 6 months in advance.If accurate data are not yet available, it is suggested disclosure should be made in stages to stabilize market expectation.In response to the news, Fan Fuchun said, "Rumors are all unreliable. It is important to study the details of what our official news spokesman says.I haven't heard about this rumor. I just learned of it from you.I can only say that I haven't verified it. I hope that everybody will not believe the rumors they hear. (Chengdu Evening News)
