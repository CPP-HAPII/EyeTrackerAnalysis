Apr. 18, 2008According to a report in Zaobao.com on the 18th, EU trade chief Mandelson has warned that if countries used export restrictions to respond to soaring food prices, it might trigger a wave a protectionism.Mandelson said,"These policies throttle domestic production, choke off supplies to other countries, and therefore increase the risk of a spiral of protectionism and dwindling production."Countries are worried that surging food prices will cause turmoil.Some countries have therefore restricted or banned exports of basic commodities in order to ensure sufficient domestic supply.Indonesia's government for example has banned farmers from selling rice abroad; Kazakhstan, one of the world's top producers of wheat, has also announced it will halt foreign sales.On the other hand, Mandelson also said the food crisis could be an opportunity for developing countries that are primarily agricultural because these countries have relative advantages in the area of agriculture. Other developed countries could provide them an opportunity by permitting these poorer countries to enter their markets. This is also the best way to solve the issue of global food supply in the long term.
