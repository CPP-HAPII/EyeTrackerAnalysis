AFP on the 6th, TokyoYesterday, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda called for all Japanese people to participate together in the movement initiated by the government to fight climate change.Fukuda raised this call when holding a meeting with business leaders and government officials to discuss measures to stop global warming.This meeting was held at Lake Toya, a resort center in the mountains of Hokkido. After the meeting, Fukuda said: "The efforts of the government and the business world alone are insufficient for the necessary measures to deal with global warming." The next G-8 industrialized countries summit is scheduled to be held at Lake Toya in July.He added: "We need all the people to participate and we need people to try to change their way of life."At the G-8 industrialized countries summit to be held from July 7-9, it is expected that climate change will be the important agenda. The leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and America will attend this summit.Japan supports the Kyoto Protocol which greatly restricts the amount of emissions of greenhouse gases, but Japan has lagged far behind the emissions reductions goals it should achieve since it has recovered from the economic recession of the 1990s. Greenhouse gases are considered the main factor causing global warming.
