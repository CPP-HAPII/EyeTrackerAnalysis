April 6, 2008A 94-year-old elderly man in Vienna, the capital city of Austria, was sentenced to five years in prison for killing his 83-year-old wife.According to the report, on the 3rd the state court of Vienna decided to use the lightest penalty for murder in Austrian criminal laws.The report from Osterreich said that when the old man heard the ruling, at first he kept saying the prison sentence was too long. "I will die in three years," he said.However, after consulting with his lawyer, he said that he accepted this ruling.On August 16 of last year, this old man in his nineties used a knife to slit his wife's throat while she was sleeping and then tried to commit suicide by slitting his artery and striking himself with an iron bar used for tenderizing steak, but he did not succeed.According to the report, this old man who used to love sports and was said to have worked as a driver for the chief commissioner of police in Vienna for many years became depressed and fell into a slump after undergoing a heart bypass surgery last year.He never left home and would even lie in bed all day.Before this incident, the old man had tried to persuade his wife to commit suicide with him but she refused.His wife was ill with chronic lower back pain, but as a devout Catholic, she regarded suicide as a sin.His wife always encouraged him to cheer up.They were married in 1952.The old man claimed that he killed his wife to "set her free.""I am in utter despair," the old man said, "I loved my wife."
