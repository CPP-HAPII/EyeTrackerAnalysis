Colombo, 27th, (AFP).Sri Lankan officials say the Tamil Tigers used light aircraft to bomb military targets in northeast Sri Lanka this morning as security forces carried out a wave of ground attacks following a deadly car bombing by Tamil Tiger rebels.A high-level source inside the security department said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam attacked two military installations in the Weli Oya region,where security forces launched a new drive against the rebel forces yesterday.The source said, "They dropped three bombs at two locations and flew back. The damage caused is insignificant, but the attack is symbolic. It shows they have the coordinates of military installations."The source said one soldier was injured in the attacks.The source said that although the military has set up new anti-aircraft defenses in Sri Lanka's northern and eastern regions, the Czech-built Zlin-143 aircraft retreated only reluctantly after facing no obstruction.The defense ministry said the military dispatched jet aircraft a few hours later to bomb Tiger suspected artillery positions in the same region.
