January 9, 2007 08:12People's Daily Online, January 9. According to a report by the Central News Agency in Taiwan, the figures released by Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission last night indicated that approximately NT $16 billion was withdrawn from the Chinese Bank last Friday (January 5) and about NT $12 billion was withdrawn yesterday. However, approximately NT $4 billion was re-deposited, judging that it should be redeposit from major clients.However, the Central Deposit Insurance Corporation will prepare another NT $10 billion today.Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Shih Jun-ji urged depositors of the Chinese Bank again at night that all deposits are guaranteed by the treasury regardless of their types. All the money will be there and withdrawing the money will only lead to a loss in interest.Shih Jun-ji said, "The Financial Supervisory Commission has coordinated with relevant departments. There is no problem with the supply and liquidity of the funds. The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) has NT $40 billion and the deposit portion has NT $42 billion with a total of NT $82 billion.For any inadequate portion, the Financial Supervisory Commission can recommend and request the Executive Yuan to have the National Treasury Agency assure and other banks allocate the liquidity. There is absolutely enough liquidity.In addition, other media reports stated that many credit cooperatives withdrew in huge amounts on the 5th. Vice-chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission Susan Chang said that it might be credit cooperatives.The Financial Supervisory Commission had persuaded the top 100 depositors of the Chinese Bank on the matter and was successful in convincing some withdrawers.Another report stated that in response to the bank run of the Chinese Bank, Chen Ching-chun, Secretary-General of the Democratic Progressive Party, said yesterday that the Financial Supervisory Commission and the Securities and Futures Bureau could not whitewash themselves from the responsibilities with the few words "depositors can all get their money". They should both be responsible. Otherwise, it is impractical to spend tens of billions of New Taiwan Dollars on the takeover. This is all people's hard-earned money and someone must bear the administrative responsibility.
