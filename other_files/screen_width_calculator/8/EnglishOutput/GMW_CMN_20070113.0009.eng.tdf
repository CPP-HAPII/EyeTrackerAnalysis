Shi Xiang (Xinhua News Agency Correspondent) 2007-01-13Soon after New Year's day for 2007 went by, German Chancellor Merkel paid a brief work visit of only four hours to the United States on January 4.According to a report, a highlight of Merkel's visit was to introduce to US President Bush the concept of a "common internal market between the EU and the US."This undoubtedly is a New Year's present from Merkel to Bush.During the visit, Merkel briefed Bush on the work plan of Germany as the rotating president of the European Union and the G8 in 2007, as well as laid the groundwork for the EU-US summit that will be held this April.The concept of a "common internal market between the EU and the US" will be an important topic at the EU-US summit.Different from the "transatlantic free trade zone" that came to a premature end in the mid 1990s, what the "common internal market between the EU and the US" emphasizes on is not free trade but the establishment of common laws and technical standards within the economic field, thereby reducing trade barriers between the EU and the US as well as cutting trading costs incurred by differences in standards, laws, and regulations, in order to achieve the objectives of integrating the EU and US markets and expanding the EU and US economies.Analysts think that this pragmatic approach by Merkel to take small steps is appropriate to the fact that currently between the EU and the US there still exists internal distrust, which precisely had caused the failure of the EU-US free trade zone in the past.In recent years, under the dual effects of realistic needs and historical tradition, the political rift between the EU and the US caused by the Iraq war is gradually closing up. The two sides are more and more willing to maintain the traditional transatlantic alliance.In comparison with improved political relations, the EU and the US are looking forward to a new economic turning point.The EU and the US, the two most important large trading zones in the world, account for 72% of the global GNP.However, conflicts often arise between them, and trade sanctions are not uncommon.Judging from the causes for EU-US trade frictions, the difference in laws, regulations, and technical standards is an important factor.In a special interview with Financial Times Deutschland, Merkel said that the different regulations that the EU and the US have in the field of patent protection gave rise to a lot of trade friction between the two sides.As such, her proposal of a "common internal market between the EU and the US" this time can be said to have hit the mark.When the EU and the US launch negotiations for the transatlantic economic framework agreement to remove trade barriers, it will surely stimulate the positive development in the EU-US economic relationship. Germany, as the "world's biggest exporter," will definitely stand to gain from this.Although Merkel stressed that the establishment of a "common internal market between the EU and the US" is not directed at any third country, the strategic importance of this common internal market is absolutely not to be underestimated, given the decisive roles that the EU and the US play in the global economy.The EU and the US hope to increase their competitiveness in the global economy through a leaders' alliance.However, whether the economic cooperation between the two powers, the EU and the US, will lead to new trade barriers and what influence the economic advantages of the EU and the US will have on global free trade are still unknown at this moment.But no matter what, the EU and the US have made another attempt to integrate the regional economy. This surely serves as an inspiration for other regions in setting up their internal markets.
