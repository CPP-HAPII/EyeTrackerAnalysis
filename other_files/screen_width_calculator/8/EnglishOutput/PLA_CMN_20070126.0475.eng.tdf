Lu Honggen (Source: PLA Daily Page 6 Issue time: 2007-01-26 06:17)From elementary school to university, then to the army, I have continuously been living a collective life.The characteristic of a collective life is that you always have people around you.But, only until that day did I realize that, although many people were physically so near to me every day, yet they had never really entered the field of vision of my mind.That day, a friend of mine came to the institution, asking me to help deal with a matter. Because he left in a hurry, he had forgotten to bring credentials.According to the rules, a stranger has to register first before entering the office building. It is not allowed to enter without credentials.My friend was kept off by the guard outside the gate; therefore, he telephoned me "for help."I telephoned the guard, asking him to allow him entrance, but was rejected by this newly arrived guard.I thought that the newly arrived guard liked to see honesty; therefore, I went to him to explain face to face, but the guard still insisted on seeing this friend's credentials according to the rules.I immediately felt like being slapped in the face, thinking to myself, how I am an institutional cadre and this is letting me lose face in front of my friend.I did not pay attention to the guard and pulled my friend along and walked toward the inside of the building.The guard was just going to say something, but I did not wait for him to open his mouth and turned my head to stop him rudely."Senior Officer, one really cannot go in without credentials. This is the rule." The guard persisted in finishing this sentence and his tears flowed out.I was immediately shocked.The story ended with my compromise. My friend left and I sat in my office in a silent daze.I was panic-stricken by my own unreasonableness and rudeness, which I unconsciously revealed. Me, who each time gets out from a taxi I do not forget to say "thank you" to the driver, could actually so rudely treat a comrade who was around me every day. Me, who often says "there's no high-and-low difference in a job," could actually subconsciously despise a soldier who guards a post.I felt ashamed in my numbness and selfishness. Every day I passed through the guard post more than ten times, yet I have never actually paid attention to the guard who day and night stands there. When writing an article I often mentioned "the basic unit is supreme, the soldier should be placed first," yet I have never tried to actually understand the life and feelings of soldiers around me."Each person is a separate world." This is a classic line in the movie "Schindler's List."Yes, everyone has his own world to belong to. Everyone has his own ideals, principles, dignities, and values.The general has the general's responsibility; the soldier has the soldier's mission.Regarding other people's worlds, we should adopt an attitude of respect and understanding.But sometimes we often indulge in our own feelings, causing our mind to become numb and closed, seeing "the world" around us without seeing, hearing without hearing.The so-called selfishness must be more or less like so.Actually, if one can open the mind's eye, using the mind to attentively understand each person, respect each person, then he may understand the world he faces, and the world of his own mind will also become much wider.
