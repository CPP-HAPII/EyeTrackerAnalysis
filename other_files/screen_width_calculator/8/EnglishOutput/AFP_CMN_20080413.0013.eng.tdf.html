SYNDEY, 13th (Sydney)Australian officials said today that following pro-Tibetan demonstrations of unprecedented intensity that the Olympic torch relay attracted in Europe, the route for the Australian stage of the relay has been changed.Organizers for the torch's two-day stop in the Australian capital Canberra said the route will not be shorter, but that security precautions will be strengthened.The organizer of the Canberra leg of the torch relay, Quinlan, said that because of security threats arising from anger over Olympic host China's repression of Tibet, the arranged torch route was still being revised.He told AFP, "We are revising the route.Our revising of the original route is wholly due to our need to consider security along the route."Quinlan said it was regrettable the new route would only be announced about forty-eight hours before the torch arrived in Australia on April 23, and that the distance between the public and torch would be greater than originally planned.He said, "We will possibly choose wider roads for the relay route and the public will be somewhat farther away. There will also possibly be more security personnel between the crowds and the torch. This is very regrettable."
