London (AFP), 5th.Although England's Arsenal soccer team tied Liverpool one-one in today's Champions League match, coach Wenger still refuses to give up on the battle for the league championship.This tie resulted in Arsenal trailing the leading Manchester United by 5 points. It seems there is very little chance of winning the final league championship.+Crouch took the lead ahead of Liverpool with a goal before the end of the first half. 55 minutes in, Bendtner scored with a header, making it even. Arsenal avoided this season's first home-field defeat.Now, Wenger can only hope for the European Champion Cup.Arsenal met with Liverpool twice this month. Arsenal wasn't able to defeat Liverpool. This gave Liverpool a psychological home field advantage during their home field match with Arsenal in the European Champion Cup top-eight match on the 8th of this month.However, Wenger is still full of confidence at public occasions. He firmly shows that he will not give up unless Arsenal already has no way to compete for the championship.Wenger said: "I don't know if the battle for the league championship has already concluded or not. This depends on the other teams' match results.I previously said, we need at least 5 wins and a tie.In my mind this hasn't ended yet because, based on mathematical calculations, it hasn't ended yet."Liverpool's coach, Benitez, doesn't have the optimism of Wenger.Benitez hinted: "I think, as for them, the difficulties are already overlapping.I talked with Wenger about the battle for the league championship. You cannot lose any more points now. So it's really difficult now.Their sole choice is probably only the European Champion Cup. This is however dangerous for us."
