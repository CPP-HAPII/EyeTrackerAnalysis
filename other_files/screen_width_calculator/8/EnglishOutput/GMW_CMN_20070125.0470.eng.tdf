Correspondent Zhang Yi 2007-01-25Staff Report, Beijing, January 24 Correspondent Zhang Yi learned from the General Administration of Customs today that in 2006 customs duties and import linkage taxes levied by national customs had for the first time exceeded 600 billion US dollars, reaching 610.42 billion yuan, up by 82.59 billion yuan from the previous year, an increase of 15.7% year-on-year.Within this total, customs duties of 114.17 billion yuan were collected, and import linkage taxes of 496.25 billion yuan were collected.According to the analysis of relevant experts, the main factors in the large increase in customs tax revenue are as follows.Firstly, general trade imports, which are the main source of customs revenue, reached 333.18 billion US dollars in the whole year, a year-on-year increase of 19.1%, establishing a substantial revenue source foundation for an increase in customs tax revenue.In addition, key energy and mineral product prices on the international market continued to run at a high level, lifting the customs tax base and also pushing up the increase in customs tax revenue. Secondly, the quality of customs revenue collection was further improved. Thirdly, the customs body vigorously launched a regional and industry-based campaign against smuggling, focusing on combating the false reporting of prices. This has served as an effective deterrent to law breakers, upholding the normal order in import and export trade, and creating a positive law-enforcement environment for the collection and management of tax revenue.Director Mou Xinsheng of the General Administration of Customs said that customs tax revenue is a significant source of the nation's finances and is a comprehensive reflection of the overall state of customs law enforcement. In 2007 national customs would further perfect plans and arrangements for customs tax revenue and the mechanism for tax revenue work appraisal; drive ahead positive interaction among the three prongs of first-line supervision, follow-up management and the anti-smuggling campaign; and move the focus of tax revenue work to the enhancement of collection and management, both in terms of ability and quality.
