This led to a warning from the head of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, who said that Nigeria will be forced to import oil from overseas because all three of the country's main refineries had to be shut down due to constant abductions and attacks by anti-government organizations in the south!Under this situation, ensuring the security of oil exploration, refining, and transportation facilities in the southern Nigeria region, as well as guaranteeing the safety of foreign workers working in the above-mentioned region, became top priorities.Currently, Nigerian security forces and police are responsible for security in the southern Nigeria region.However, these fully armed security forces and police are of no use. Some places where foreign workers are stationed still come under attack even though it looks like they are heavily guarded. Workers have been abducted and safes snatched away.As such, there is a rumor spread by a few media and organizations in Nigeria, saying that the Nigerian federal government "has reached a secret agreement" with China to allow Chinese military forces to start patrolling at important target zones of the Niger Delta.They even said, without grounds, "Chinese soldiers in camouflage clothing have been seen around some oil facilities and work sites, taking over control of security and protection that was formerly under the charge of the security forces.Every one of them is tall and strong. They carry rifles of the latest models, and have started operation with three to five people in one patrol team."These rumors also said, "If the results are obvious, the Chinese troops will take on more security and protection tasks."[1]
