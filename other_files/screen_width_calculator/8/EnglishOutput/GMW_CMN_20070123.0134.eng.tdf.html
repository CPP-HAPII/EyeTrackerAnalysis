January 23, 2007For many migrant workers, the approach of the end of the lunar year is like a difficult-to-cross threshold.Over the past several years, the "news of demanding overdue wages" such as "demanding overdue wages with the threat of jumping from a building," "demanding overdue wages by kneeling" and "demanding overdue wages by obstructing the road" has been a focus of people's heated discussion.But what is different from previous years is that this year, a "new variety" has been added to the "news of demanding overdue wages," and that is, demanding overdue wages by sending greeting cards.According to a "Chinese Business View" report yesterday, over 30 migrant workers came to a post office in Xi'an several days ago and deposited several greeting cards into the mailbox.But these cards were not intended for their loved ones; rather, they were delivered to the Shaanxi No.8 Construction Engineering Company, which had delayed in paying them their overdue wages of over 300,000 Yuan.Since ancient times, China has a tradition of "achieving prosperity through industriousness." And it is precisely with this vision that more and more peasants have, since reform and opening up, made their way into the cities.But unfortunately, just when many migrant workers were working day and night, shedding their blood and sweat for the construction of cities after cities, life had played a massive joke on them -- just when they were hoping that their dreams would come true, the dream of "achieving prosperity through industriousness" had overnight turned into two harsh realities. On the one hand, in terms of procedure, they were invariably "industrious" and hard-working; but on the other hand, in terms of outcome, they had to ceaselessly travel on the path of demanding their wages, without having the chance to savor the taste of "prosperity."A peasant involved in "demanding overdue wages by sending greeting cards" wrote in the card: "My old mother had fallen ill again, and my wife had borrowed yet another 1,000 Yuan from a neighbor, and has asked me to return the money soon.But I cannot even afford the money to go home, and I cannot tell that to my wife. So I hope the leaders will pay me the wages after receiving this card.I wish you a great fortune in the Year of the Pig." So where does this idea of "demanding overdue wages by sending greeting cards" come from?It is said that the creative idea came from a peasant called Fu Shibo.Not long ago, he received a greeting card from his 5-year-old son, asking him to buy and bring home a toy.Inspired by this, Fu Shibo conceived the idea of demanding overdue wages by sending greeting cards.Even though these cards were permeated with the warmth of human-heartedness, we can also at the same time detect the large sense of frustration and helplessness.This is a detail worth recalling.Obviously, for these peasants, it is their basic right to get their wages after contributing their labor, and it is not necessary to be as obsequious and cautious as kids begging their parents for something.Faced with the issue of "demanding overdue wages by sending greeting cards," the official in charge of the Shaanxi Provincial Labor and Social Security Department Publicity Center showed up in person and pointed out that migrant workers should first turn to labor administration departments and courts to recover their wages, and which is also a more effective way in resolving the problem of unpaid wages.This kind of "instruction" is not without its reason.However, the problem is that after so many years of being immersed in "the culture of demanding overdue wages," don't migrant workers know that they should turn to the public authorities for support?Obviously, migrant workers are not willing to beg for their income obtained through their labor in a quiet and obsequious manner.When the dignity and justice of the law is not upheld, we still continue to remain at the stage of criticizing or instructing migrant workers about their ignorance in safeguarding their rights through the public authorities; and this means unfairness for these workers.In a sense, the further abuse of such criticism or instruction means that we may lapse into a type of unrighteousness, and that is, through criticizing people's "ignorance" to cover up the embarrassing situation of "powerlessness" of the laws or public authorities.Everyone has an instinct of pursuing advantages and avoiding detriments, and everyone is capable of operating their rational faculties. If the laws can make it more convenient and effective in the upholding of justice, migrant workers will naturally turn to the laws to resolve their problems.In fact, when facing the annual act of extensive wage arrears, here we are discussing the ways in which migrant workers can recover their wages and how they can safeguard their rights through the laws, but these also come with their own profound paradoxes.Obviously, the most urgent problem right now is to resort to the help of the law to ensure that acts of wage arrears would not happen again, and not to examine the ways to recover overdue wages after they had occurred.This reasoning is actually very simple.If there is a place which is targeted by arsonists all year round, the most important thing is naturally to bring the arsonists to justice, and not for the government and public to watch their own turf by promoting their own fire-extinguishing products.
