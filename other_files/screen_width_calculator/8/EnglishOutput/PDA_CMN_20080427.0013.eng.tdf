April 27, 2008people.com.cn, April 27thMa Ying-jeou's new cabinet members will be announced tomorrow. According to reports, the "Mainland Affairs Council's chair," which attracts attention from all over, will be held by a woman. Taiwan Solidarity Union's previous "legislator," Lai Hsing-yuan, is expected to be the dark horse that surprises everyone. However, Ma and Siew's office has not confirmed this personnel plan. They stressed that the relevant people are to be officially announced tomorrow.According to a report from Taiwan's "United Evening News," future "Executive Yuan premier," Liu Chao-shiuan, will announce the "national security" position, "Minister of Finance," and other cabinet ministers tomorrow morning at 10:30 at Taipei city mayor's official residence. A reliable source points out that it is already confirmed that the "National Science Council Chair," will be the current president of "National Central University," Lee Lou-chuan and the previous "National Science Council Chair," Chang Jin-Fu, will take up post as "Executive Yuan Government Affairs Committee Officer."Lai Hsing-yuan was from Taichung city, has a PH.D in development research from Britain's University of Sussex and has a Masters in Comparative Politics and International Relations from the London School of Economics and Political Science. She has deeply researched regional conformity, international politics and economics, the WTO and economic security strategy and other fields.After the Democratic Progressive Party rose to power in 2000, she took up the post of "National Security Council member" on the suggestion of Chen Shui-bian and during the final juncture of Taiwan's talks on entering the WTO, she was Taiwan's negotiator.After Lai Hsing-yuan represented the Taiwan Solidarity Union as the 6th nationwide "legislator" 4 years ago, she gained the approval of others by working hard on the issue of caring for the disadvantaged.According to reports, Ma Ying-jeou really admires her, and also because Lai Hsing-yuan and Lee Teng-hui have a close relationship, during the "presidential election," Lai Hsin-yuan was also an important channel for Ma's camp's struggle for Lee Teng-hui's support.
