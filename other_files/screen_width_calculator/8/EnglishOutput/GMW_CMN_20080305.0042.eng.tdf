(Staff reporters: Wu Chunyan, Zhang Jinghua) 2008-03-05 .During the Spring Festival travel period, Guangzhou Train Station is jammed with people, and many travellers that have waited a long time have also built up a lot of rancor.At times like this, once the flood of people surges, some people are inadvertently thrown to the ground and it becomes extremely easy for people to get trampled, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries.One day, female police were separating the crowd into lanes, when a ((pw)) or eight-year-old child suddenly appeared among the bustling flow of people. The situation was critical.At that moment, the child was pulled away by a human form.The "big sister" that had rescued him was named Xiao Qian. Training for perfection had given her speedy reflexes.However, the small child had been frightened and, with a "wahhh", began to cry out loud. Female polices Wang Wenjing and Jiang Ting, who were nearby, rushed forward and comforted the child while also inquiring into the whereabouts of his family and searching for his family members among the vast flow of people.When the young mother saw her child safe and sound, she tightly held the female police officer's hand with tears welling in her eyes.On February 2, the number of people was at its greatest.At 12 noon that day, in accordance with the command center's orders, the protection barrier on Zhanqian Lu South was opened so that an organized flow of impatiently waiting travelers could enter the station.In an instant, the travelers anxious to return home surged forward all together as if floodgates had been opened. Shrieks and cries rose hear and there. Some children were even swept away by the flow of people.Female police officer Huang Yanli, attached to the Station of Vehicle Management, Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and her colleagues realized there was a problem: the situation of children squeezed among the crowd was desperate!Huang Yanli and her four colleagues immediately rushed to the metal barricades that divided the flow of people.Standing beside the metal barricades, the police picked up their loudspeakers and hollered toward the inside: "Those accompanied by children, please pass the children over here. The police will watch over them for you."The layers of people near the metal barricade passed on the children they were handed. Huang Yanli reached out to receive them and, as each child was placed in her hands, she immediately placed the child in the empty space behind her, and prepared to receive the next one.In this way, Huang Yanli and her colleagues received more than twenty children after a short period of effort.The children were very quickly taken to a small restaurant called the South-north Fine Food Cafe at the exit of the barricade line.Yan Huangli and her colleagues gathered the children together and borrowed some stools from the restaurant for the children to stand on.When they couldn't all stand on the stools, the children formed a circle around the stools and Huang Yanli was like a mother hen protecting her chicks from the wind and rain.A small "temporary kindergarten" was born. Huang Yanli, Peng Jin, Jiang Chunlan, Li Yanfen,Chen Jieming--these female police officers who normally greet the public at the window of the Vehicle Management Station, were suddenly fulfilling the task of watching over children and screening parents. The work lasted for up to twelve hours or more each day.These flowers of policehood patiently sought to comfort the children. They used dumplings, candies and others things to soothe the children and stabilize their emotions.Most of the children were crying, fiercely crying.The traffic police officers thought of another method: The police in front of the "metal barricades" opened up one side close to one side of the elegant plain-clothes police building, and then temporarily changed to "entry" the opening for the direction from the train station to the plain-clothes police building and which is normally only an "exit, so that the children's parents could enter.The greatest concern of the police was that the children might be taken by somebody posing as a parent.Therefore, each time a parent came to collect a child, the police would ask that the parent to give an identifying feature of the child's body or some other proof.Police officer Liang Liqing said, "What gratified us most is that not one child was taken by somebody posing as a parent and all the children were returned to their parents' embrace without the slightest injury. We are most happy and delighted over this.As the parents found their children, they cried on each other's shoulders.Many parents said with great emotion that these police were "sonorous roses" that proved that they can maintain security during the Spring Festival travel period.
