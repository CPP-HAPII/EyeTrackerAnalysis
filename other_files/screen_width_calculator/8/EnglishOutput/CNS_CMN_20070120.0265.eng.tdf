January 20, 2007, 10:35Chinanews.com, January 20 - Israel yesterday released a portion of the Palestinian taxes it withheld for a long period of time by transferring 100 million US dollars (about 154 million Singapore dollars) to the Palestinian National Authority.According to a Zaobao.com report, the move was in line with the agreement reached between Palestinian President Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Olmert on December 23 last year. Furthermore, it is also to help Abbas fight against the Hamas group, a radical political party currently ruling Palestine.At the same time, Israeli Defense Minister Peretz also announced that plans to construct a new Israeli immigrant settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank have been frozen.This plan has been consistently criticized by the international community.After Hamas was elected as the ruling party in March last year, Israel withheld the customs duties it had collected on behalf of the Palestinian government. The total amount added up to over 600 million US dollars, and had placed Palestine in a precarious financial crisis.For several months, many governmental employees could only collect a partial salary.A senior official from the Israeli Prime Minister's Office yesterday confirmed with AFP that "according to an agreement reached earlier between both parties, we have already transferred 100 million US dollars to the account of the Israeli president this morning.""This amount of money will be used for humanitarian purposes, and also for strengthening the presidential guard of Palestinian President Abbas." The Israeli side also pointed out that this amount of money was not to be used by the Palestinian government for paying the salaries of government employees.
