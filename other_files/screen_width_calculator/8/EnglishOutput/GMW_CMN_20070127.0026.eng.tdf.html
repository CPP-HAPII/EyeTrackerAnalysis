Yang Jining 2007-01-27On January 21, the People's Daily carried an article, "Hebei deals with 'bureaucratic workstyles' in order to promote efficiency in government offices." This article pointed out that since March 2005 Hebei Province had cracked down on "bureaucratic workstyles" and promoted efficiency in government offices, with the aim of "improving quality and speed, working for the people and promoting development."Over nearly two years, 617 efficiency complaint centers have been set up throughout the province, 14,696 complaints were handled, and 1,444 people were disciplined by suspension, removal and dismissal.Hebei Province's way of cracking down on "bureaucratic workstyles" is appropriate and effective, winning the general approval of society.While giving their approval, people cannot help thinking that the cause of "bureaucratic workstyles" must be governed by certain rules. These rules are none other than the hidden rules in official circles.While bringing "bureaucratic workstyles" under control, we should not neglect to resolve the root problem of hidden rules in official circles.What is meant by a "bureaucratic workstyle?"The article says that chatting, playing games, and playing cards while at work; eating fruit while ordinary people are visiting the offices, speaking down to them, and passing the buck ... these startling "bureaucratic workstyles," this sort of behavior, have led to common problems such as "difficulties in getting things done, improper official conduct, the inferior character of officials, impractical ways of doing things, low efficiency, red tape, and ceremonialism."Only by investigating the root cause of this type of behavior and tackling the problems at the root can we achieve a fundamental resolution of this persistent malady.The thinking generated by the behavior of government officials under feudalism is still influencing people's words and conduct. Hidden rules in official circles are one of the causes of a "bureaucratic workstyle."Hidden rules in official circles are the code of conduct privately observed by people in official circles who deviate from the formal system of laws and regulations.It refers in particular to a code of conduct that cannot be officially adopted or written down, and is even improper to mention, yet is widely accepted in real life.Someone has described it as invisible yet ubiquitous, not officially recognized yet firmly grounded, contrary to all emotions and reasons yet accepted everywhere.Hidden rules in official circles originated from the behavior of those petty officials and government workers in feudal society and people who did not engage in the four professions (the four professions being academia, agriculture, industry and business).They are gluttonous and lazy, scratch each other's backs, and use clever words and a suggestive manner. They cheat their superiors and deceive their subordinates. They influence, persuade and seduce officials, and finally cause officials to fall into the trap of hidden rules from which they cannot extricate themselves, thereby encouraging the further development of a culture of hidden rules.Wu Si, the author of "Hidden Rules," once said, "I reckon that every Chinese person knows in his heart that behind explicit regulations there frequently lie hidden a set of implicit rules, the sort of things that could be described as an internal constitution.If you don't realize this, then it is hard to avoid coming to grief." To someone who has just entered the "circle," these are not written in black and white in confidential government documents. You cannot "learn them from books." Only after a person has bumped into a lot of obstacles and started to respect this set of implicit rules will "the person be considered understanding, matured, and worldly-wise."The essence of the various manifestations of the "bureaucratic workstyle" enumerated by Hebei is, in fact, the external disclosure of the hidden rules in official circles.There are many expressions used by ordinary people to describe the manifestations of hidden rules in official circles.So you've got: report good news but not bad news; absorb a problem internally when it arises; don't give your opinion of leaders; people connected to leaders are equivalent to leaders themselves; don't steal the limelight; put off thorny matters; don't meddle in your predecessor's affairs; express fewer views and ask for more instructions; hold more meetings to build up a momentum; report problems as if they were achievements; collectively study breaches of the regulations; it's not illegal to eat and drink; pay attention to the advent of political movements and nothing will happen to you once they blow over, etc. Anyone who does not observe these rules is seen as an outsider and got rid of.The vogue for hidden rules in official circles means that party discipline and the law of the land are inevitably just for show; orders are not implemented and bans are not enforced, leading to an unhealthy atmosphere and bad practices where self-serving people hold sway and good people are victimized.In places where hidden rules are in vogue, many people no longer turn to the system to resolve problems and do not handle them in accordance with normal regulations and procedures, but rely on their connections or influential backers.And you need to ply these backers and connections with money or gifts in order to approach them. Consequently, the trend to give and receive bribes in official circles is quietly on the increase.If we continue along these lines, the future of the country and the fate of our people will be extremely dreadful and critical.Therefore, when tackling "bureaucratic workstyles," we need to resolve the root problem of hidden rules in official circles.Hidden rules in official circles are originally the outcome of the feudal system. Most people imagine that these feudal-style hidden rules in official circles should have vanished into thin air with the collapse of feudal society.In fact, it is not so simple.Lenin said that the death of the old society is not like the death of a person, where the dead body is taken away and everything is over. It can rot away in our midst and poison us.Marx also said, "The old always strives for restoration and consolidation in new forms." This means that eliminating hidden rules in official circles is a long-term task. We need to constantly criticize feudal degenerate thought and culture, create a communist public service mindset, build a corps of officials who establish the Party for the public and hold power for the people, and eradicate the thinking that lies behind hidden rules in official circles.As regards the system, we need to vigorously develop socialist democratic politics, with everyone taking on the responsibility so that the people can supervise the government. Let all rules be drawn up in the open and implemented in the open.
