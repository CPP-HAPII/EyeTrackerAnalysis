April 6, 2008The Lake Poyang Ecological Protection and Resource Utilization Project, a national scientific and technical support plan key project in which Rmb18 million has been invested, was set in motion in recent days in Jiangxi.The Office of the Mountain-River-Lake Development Committee of Jiangxi Province explained that this is the largest scientific and technical investment ever in Jiangxi by the Ministry of Science and Technology.The project's advance will protect the ecological safety of Lake Poyang and provide scientific and technical support aimed at promoting sustainable development in the Lake Poyang region. At the same time, it will also provide a source of reference for environmental protection and aquatic ecosystem security of China's lakes.The director of the Office of Mountain-River-Lake Development Committee of Jiangxi Province explained that the project has five subject domains, including monitoring and early warning of the aquatic ecosystem, control of water pollution, control of soil erosion, restoration and rebuilding of the wetland ecosystem, and prevention of schistosomiasis.It is predicted that once the project is completed, it will be possible to establish a database for monitoring Lake Poyang's aquatic ecosystem as well as a monitoring and early-warning platform. This will enable the damaged wetland ecosystem to essentially return to its natural state, desertified land to be replanted up to 80% coverage, schistosomiasis in model counties to fall within transmission-control standards, and economic efficiency in trial districts to increase 15%.Lake Poyang is China's largest freshwater lake and 97% of the area under Jiangxi province's jurisdiction falls within the Lake Poyang watershed.In recent years, with increasingly rapid industrialization and urbanization in Jiangxi, industrial and human pollution of water has increased, and water quality safety has become a severe challenge."Water management" has gradually become the core of the province's ecosystem management.
