2008-03-05Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, March 3 (Reporter Wang Xiangjiang, Wu Zhiqiang) - On the 3rd, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Wang Guangya, said the new resolution on the Iranian nuclear issue passed by the Security Council is not to punish Iran, but rather is to promote the revival of a new round of diplomatic efforts.In the explanatory statement made by Wang Guangya after the Security Council passed the new resolution on the Iranian nuclear issue, it was pointed out that the Security Council's passing of a new resolution on the Iranian nuclear issue is not only another one of the international community's efforts to maintain the nuclear non-proliferation system, but is also an expression of each party's hope to peacefully solve the Iranian nuclear issue as early as possible through diplomatic negotiations.The purpose of the new resolution is not to punish Iran but rather to promote the revival of a new round of diplomatic efforts.The relevant sanctions do not target the Iranian people and also do not affect the normal trade and financial dealings between each country and Iran.Wang Guangya stressed that sanctions cannot solve the problems from the roots. Diplomatic negotiations are still the best choice.He called on the relevant parties to adopt a high degree of responsibility and a constructive attitude, to fully bring their proactiveness and creativity to bear and to persistently and ceaselessly strengthen multilateral diplomatic efforts, to seek a plan that not only ensures Iran's right to use nuclear energy peacefully but is also useful in safeguarding the international non-proliferation mechanism, to strive for the early long-term, comprehensive and appropriate solution to the issue.On the third, the United Nations Security Council passed resolution number 1803, regarding the Iranian nuclear issue, with a vote of 14 for and 1 abstention. Through this vote, it was decided to further increase sanctions directed towards the Iranian nuclear program and its related fields. However, at the same time it showed the continuing enhancement of diplomatic efforts aimed at solving the Iranian nuclear issue.This is the third resolution imposing sanctions on Iran passed by the Security Council since December 2006.
