It was decided that all government agencies and institutions must use Arabic as the main official language.The reports said that the cabinet meeting decided all institutions of the UAE's seven member states must list Arabic as their official language. In addition it decided to establish an education, coordination, and integration committee to step up the popularization and promotion of Arabic.Article Seven of the UAE constitution stipulates that the United Arab Emirates are Arab nations, and that Arabic is the number one official language.However, of the ten commonly-used languages today, Arabic only ranks fourth, while English ranks first.The results of a population census conducted by the UAE in 2006 showed that of a population of more than four million, about 80% were non-natives, while native residents had become the minority.The non-native population comes separately from more than 200 countries and more than 150 nationalities. One hundred dialects are used. English has become the everyday language used by many institutions, especially private enterprises and universities.
