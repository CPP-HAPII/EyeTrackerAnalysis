This Newspaper's Commentator, 2008-03-05.Today is the 110th birthday of the loved and respected Comrade Zhou Enlai.On this special day, we recall this great person of distinguished feats, review those events from the past that move people's hearts. Our hearts surge and it is difficult to be tranquil."Premier Zhou," this is what the people fondly called him.Chinese people are lucky to have nurtured such a good premier.The iridescence he painted on the sky of history, the footprint he left on the motherland's earth, the impression he left in people's hearts, is our nationalities' eternal memory.Comrade Zhou Enlai lived in a "weak and uncompetitive" China, and an age of "insults from foreign countries and persecution from Japan."Grave disaster and crisis aroused his powerful love of country and sense of responsibility."For the rise of China," this is the oath made during his youth and also a credo he worked perseveringly for his whole life.Everybody is responsible for the fate of his country."One should do whatever it takes for the life or death of one's country."In order to rescue the country from peril and seek prosperity for the people, he was dashing around his whole life, cheering, overturning, revolutionizing, building.For the ambitious undertaking of reviving the nation, he spared no effort, feared no danger and welcomed difficulty.He experienced the blood and stench of the revolution, experienced the smoke and flames of war, experienced the great momentum of building a new China. His eyes were like torches and he marched fearlessly onward.His magnificent, colorful career is a vivid footnote in the Chinese nation's move towards strength and prosperity.All of this was "for the rise of China." Comrade Zhou Enlai set a magnificent example for us.A great country and prosperous people - this is what Chinese people have pursued for a hundred years.As a good son of the Chinese people, Comrade Zhou Enlai's life was a life of untiring struggle just "for the rise of China."We remember Comrade Zhou Enlai's great achievements, study Comrade Zhou Enlai's great spirit and just want to be like him, studying hard "for the rise of China;" working hard "for the rise of China;" sparing no effort in our duty and unswervingly adhering to our duty "for the rise of China."Today, reform and opening-up and the construction of modernized socialism have made achievements that command the attention of the world. The Chinese people's mighty recovery reveals a bright and glittering future.We are on a new historical starting point. The mission is even more glorious and the responsibility is even more significant.We should indeed carry on the wishes of Zhou Enlai and other revolutionaries from the older generation. Under the guidance of the spirit of the Party's 17th meeting, hold high the mighty flag of China's socialism with Chinese characteristics, continue liberating thought, persist in reforming and opening-up, push forward scientific development, promote social harmony, forever remember "for the rise of China," and strive to build our country into a strong, democratic, civilized, and harmonious, modernized socialist country.
