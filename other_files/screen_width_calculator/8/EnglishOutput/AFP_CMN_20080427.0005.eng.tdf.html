Teheran (AFP), 26th.According to the results of the final vote count that were announced today, after going through two rounds of voting for the parliamentary election, Iranian conservatives won a majority of the seats.However, the new parliament still criticizes the conservative president, Ahmadinejad.Interior Minister Mohammadi said the conservatives took 69% of the seats, the reformists won 16% of the seats, and independents took 14% of the seats.Iran held the second round of voting for parliamentary elections yesterday to select 82 members of parliament out of a total of 290 seats.The first round of elections was held on March 14th. At that time, it was already certain that the conservatives would win big.Mohammadi did not reveal the number of seats that each party won, but the percentages that he revealed imply that the conservatives took about two hundred seats, the reformists won about 50 seats and the independents stole about 40 seats.Mohammadi said: "By my evaluation, the new parliament will be more capable and have more professional knowledge than the old parliament.I hope the government and parliament will have stronger interactions."The number of votes that the reformists received outside of Teheran isn't bad, but is very poor within Teheran.In Teheran, the conservatives carried away 10 of the 11 seats that were up for the final election.
