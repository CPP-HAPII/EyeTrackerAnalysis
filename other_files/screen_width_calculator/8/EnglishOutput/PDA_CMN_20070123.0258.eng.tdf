January 23, 2007 17:02Chinanews, January 23 In response to the release of the "state affairs fund" documents, today (the 23rd) both the KMT and the DPP groups decided to carry out their offensive and defense moves targeting specific details. In addition, whether Chen Shui-bian will request for a "constitutional interpretation" was also drawing attention. However, according to the information in the indictment, the "South Route secret" among the six "secret diplomatic missions" was a fabrication.According to consolidated relevant reports by Taiwan's BCC World Wide Web, the KMT said that as Wu Shu-chen and officials from the "Presidential Office" had put up passive resistance during the court session, the release of the documents now will reveal the truth of this case.The DPP, on the other hand, denounced the public release of the documents for violation of the "Classified National Security Information Protection Act," and the party will fully support Chen Shui-bian in requesting for a "constitutional interpretation."It was learned that the collegiate bench of the Taipei "District Court" determined on the 19th that in the "state affairs fund" case, the six "secret diplomatic missions" authorized by Chen Shui-bian are "not secrets," and the documents are to be released on the 23rd.The KMT is glad to see that this decision went through. "Legislator" Lin Te-fu said that after the documents are released, the secrets of the "state affairs fund" will be brought to light and all Taiwanese will then know whether Chen Shui-bian committed corruption in the name of "secrets."He hopes that the court will take an active role in hearing this case and settle everything in the shortest time possible, as Ah-Bian has been putting up passive resistance for fear that he has to resign if found guilty.The DPP believes that this move by the Taipei "District Court" has triggered a major "state security" crisis, an "unrivaled crisis for Taiwan."A "legislator" said that relevant laws and regulations have explicit provisions related to "state secrets," and that right now there should not be a public reading of the documents. He urged the trial judge to solemnly and seriously consider the impact that public reading of the documents will have on Taiwan.The DPP spares no effort in backing Chen Shui-bian. Besides showing their support for Chen Shui-bian in requesting for a "constitutional interpretation," they will also set up a "constitutional government crisis management team" to handle related issues.In addition, the Taipei "District Court" ruled that the documents for the six major "secret diplomatic missions" in the "state affairs fund" case are not deemed secrets and are to be released.On the 22nd, "Presidential Office" Deputy Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai stressed that any dispute over Chen Shui-bian's exercise of the "state secrets" privilege vested in his position in accordance with the "Constitution" shall be resolved through "constitutional interpretation."As the Taipei "District Court" did not accept the "official" explanation and kept to its ruling to open the documents for reading as per scheduled, the "Presidential Office" subsequently made an unyielding statement that the relevant individuals should be held liable when "the security and interests of the state" was compromised as a result of releasing the secret documents to the public.Will more specific actions be taken today?Rumors that Chen Shui-bian will +apply for a "constitutional interpretation" within the next few days has aroused the attention of everyone, but the "Presidential Office" has not made any further comments today.In the court hearing of the "state affairs fund" case, the prosecution and defense have all along focused their arguments on whether the six "secret diplomatic" missions are "state secrets." Now that the collegiate bench ruled that the "Classified National Security Information Protection Act" is inapplicable, the trial of the whole case is expected to speed up.Furthermore, according to the indictment of the prosecution, the "South Route secret diplomacy project," among the six "secret diplomatic" missions initially mentioned by Chen Shui-bian, was fabricated. Although other missions are partially true, they are still deemed to involve forgery of documents as "state affairs funds" were not allowed to be used.To be specific, the six "secret diplomatic missions" mentioned by Chen Shui-bian have always been the focus of arguments between the prosecution and defense in the court hearing of the "state affairs fund" case, and the "Presidential Office" had twice refused to respond in defiance of the ruling of the collegiate bench on grounds that the case involved confidentiality.According to the initial indictment of the prosecution, the so-called six "secret diplomatic missions" include the "Mister A" case (known to outsiders as the "South Route secret diplomacy project"), "secret diplomatic mission in Northeast Asia," "Annette Lu's appreciation activities to promote Taiwan's bid for UN membership," "sponsorship of democracy activists abroad," and payments to Ford and Associates. Prosecutors' investigation shows that all missions are real except for the "Mister A" case which is fabricated by Tseng Tien-tsu, the former chief of the confidential office of the "government." However, since some "diplomatic missions" were not allowed to use the "secret mission funds" of the "state affairs funds," they were deemed to involve forgery of documents.
