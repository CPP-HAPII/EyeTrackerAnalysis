Yu Dong 2007-01-05In the last three years, nearly all aspects of the Chinese film industry chain have shown a pre-explosion growth trend. This year the number of film productions has soared, and box office revenues have also gone up significantly, reflecting a side of the Chinese film market that is currently in the stage of rapid development.Meanwhile, some problems in the industrialization process have also surfaced.This year's Crazy Stone sets a very good example for the future market of small-budget domestic films, deserving our special attention.In the last three years, nearly all aspects of the Chinese film industry chain have shown a pre-explosion growth trend. This year the number of film productions has soared, and box office revenues have also gone up significantly, reflecting a side of the Chinese film market that is currently in the stage of rapid development.Meanwhile, some problems in the industrialization process have also surfaced.More Guarantees on Capital Returns and ProfitsThe national film box office for 2006 is estimated to be around 2.6 billion yuan, a marked increase compared with last year's box office revenues of 2 billion yuan.On the one hand, this is attributed to the increase in the number of film productions, and on the other hand, it is because the 300 screens newly added throughout the country this year are all spread out among the 60 new modern multiplexes that are built this year. These 300 screens are quality-guaranteed active screens with high attendance rates.Companies in the advertising industry are increasingly appreciating the special features of films as a media platform, and are pumping in more money year after year.Correspondingly, many domestic productions have taken a big step forward in market integration and promotion this year. All sorts of embedded advertisements, television media advertisements, and outdoor advertisements appeared especially for a few mega productions such as Fearless, Confession of Pain, The Banquet, and The City of Golden Armor.In addition, the distribution channels of films in the country are gradually diversifying.The development of new media such as the Internet is especially starting to have a direct impact on the film industry. Domestic distributors have all begun to get involved in the Internet and IPTV channel distribution this year. Films that are "associated with the Internet" range from mega productions like Dragon Tiger Gate and The Banquet to various kinds of small-budget productions like Crazy Stone and Luxury Car.This year, with some mega commercial films such as The Banquet, Dragon Tiger Gate, and The City of Golden Armor selling like hot cakes at various major film festivals and various major film trading markets overseas, China's domestic film companies, including Hong Kong companies, are starting to build up influence abroad. Many international buyers have even begun making follow-up trips to Beijing and Hong Kong to buy films.The significant rise in overseas revenues of Chinese films has become a major phenomenon.As the film industry has gradually gained the attention and support of the advertising industry, telecommunications industry, and new media in China, revenues from film copyrights are also diversified. Furthermore, with the gradual improvement and perfection of various regulations in the legal and financial systems as well as the insurance industry, film investors have more guarantees on capital returns and profits.There Are Still Prominent DilemmasHowever, while Chinese films are "growing rapidly" by various statistics, they also face numerous dilemmas and embarrassment.For instance, behind the 50% increase in the number of domestic productions this year in comparison with last year, what is the increase ratio of films that were really put into the market and given a certain scale of market distribution?Have ordinary viewers honestly felt such increase?Following this thought, there are still many issues that require serious consideration: The number of screens is increasing continuously, but how did this year's average ticket price nationwide change as compared with the same period last year?With a steep progressive increase in investment amount, what are the input-output effects of the industry?This year, due to various reasons such as piracy, the market for original DVDs has almost slid to its bottom in the last few years. Although Internet broadband, IPTV, and the like have risen to the occasion, they still come under restrictions from various sides, being able to only share the fringe benefits from films...The above issues demand that we no longer only seek an increase in the number of film productions, but should also boost the domestic market returns for mega commercial films and some ((pw)) and medium-cost films.For instance, while box office is skyrocketing, is it possible to reduce the distribution cost?It is a waste of resources when operating cost is too high.In addition, the copyright revenues from television stations should be further increased. Currently film channels are exclusive operators. Avenues should be opened to allow more television stations to participate in buying films.At present, the illegal broadcast of films by television stations every year brings rather huge losses to the film industry. While combating piracy and illegal film broadcasting, the State should guide them so that they can purchase films through a reasonable film sales channel.The domestic film industry is in urgent need for standardization. For instance, all government departments and people from all industries need to give support in areas of perfecting laws, giving preferential tax treatment, and enhancing banking and financial service systems, including controlling the film industry environment, combating piracy committed through Internet downloads, combating DVD piracy, combating illegal broadcast of films by television stations, protecting the investment and operation environments of the film industry.Crazy Stone Reveals "Three Steps" for Low-cost Domestic FilmsThe diversified needs of the film market determine that domestic filmmakers cannot only produce mega commercial films with high investment, but should also offer the audience commercial films of more different genres and scales, as well as other types of productions.As such, compared against mega commercial productions like The Banquet and The City of Golden Armor, Crazy Stone, a low-cost dark comedy this summer, sets a very good example for the future market for small-budget domestic productions. The inspiration it gives to the industry insiders especially deserves attention.Crazy Stone, a film entirely about mainland China, was produced by mainland director and actors in mainland China. Two-thirds of the cost was funded by ATV Hong Kong, and it was packaged with the "FOCUS: First Cuts" concept. Through selling a certain period of copyright for use in mainland China, the other one-third of the investment comes from a mainland company. The ultimate copyright of the film, however, remains in Hong Kong. This is a successful joint investment model between Hong Kong and the mainland, and such model that uses the joint production method to expand the overseas market is exactly the first step of the "three-step" strategy that is worth learning by domestic filmmakers.Right now, due to limited space in the mainland market, the country can only take on a part of the total film investment for ordinary domestic productions; the remaining capital should come from other markets within the Mandarin-speaking regions.A more feasible way is to produce some low-cost films by cooperating with Hong Kong and Taiwanese markets through pre-sales.The second step is to gradually develop overseas buyers of Chinese films.Allow buyers who buy Chinese films to first make profits, thereby forming a long-term strategic cooperation relationship.Chinese films should be introduced abroad in a collective and large-scale manner, and film buyers there must be developed.If a region spends 200,000 to 300,000 US dollars to buy a domestic production, this would be a huge support.The third step is to rely on the future potential of our robust mainland Chinese market.If there is 20 billion in box office every year in future, there will be no need for joint production, and producing films about mainland China is entirely workable. When that time comes, even young directors can appear in the market through various forms of films.In our opinion, the prospects for Chinese films in 2007 will be thriving and encouraging, but on the other hand we should recognize clearly the irrationality of the tendency of the "extensive" growth model in the Chinese film industry. Mentality cannot determine everything, but at least it can influence the perspective in which one considers problems. To have a more in-depth understanding of the current development of the Chinese film market and to look into the next years and future, an appropriate mentality is very much needed. This is especially so around the end of the year when people are busy with making hasty summaries.
