January 8, 2007, 10:40Chinanews.com, January 8 - The training of the PLA started along with the new year, and all troops gathered at the drilling grounds, filled with vigor and all set for action.Officers and soldiers took the initiative to raise the training benchmarks and trained strictly according to the programs. There were many new highlights at the drilling grounds that brought out the new characteristics of the changes in military training.Today's issue of PLA Daily published a report on the commencement of the PLA's training that reflected the new military training spirit for the troops in the new year.The editorial notes in the article state that this year is an important year for thoroughly carrying out the spirit of the PLA Military Training Conference and actively pushing forward the transformation from mechanized military training to informationized military training.One big highlight for this year's military training will be to work hard in refining integrated training and conscientiously perfecting the training of command departments to constantly improve the informationized combat capability of the troops.On January 7, cold wind swept through a military airport in southwest China.Amid intermittent roars that sound like rolling thunder, each of the new J-10 fighter planes, with which an aviation division of Chengdu Military Region Air Force is recently equipped, whizzed up into the air and struck the sky horizon like sharp swords, starting off the first flight training of the new year.In the command tower, commanders have real-time supervision and control over every action of the pilots in the air through a training management information system. The moment the pilots get out of the fighter plane, they can check their flight parameters, such as flight path and offensive posture, through an automatic flight parameter grading system... "The strong atmosphere of informationized training comes from the high informationization level of the J-10 fighter planes," explained Li Yong, the division commander who was in the airfield tower commanding the first flight of the new year. Since the troops were equipped with the new J-10 fighter planes, the division has been revolving around the features of the new fighter planes in making informationized military training, which focuses mainly on supervision of flight quality, an emphasis for increasing combat effectiveness. It started working toward a key technological breakthrough by developing an informationized training quality supervision system that combines automatic flight parameter data management, automatic reading of flight parameters, and automatic online publishing and search of flight parameter results to provide a real-time query on the flight data of each flight, hence effectively increasing the quality of the flight training.After completing one flying course, Assistant Regiment Commander Zhang Weilin, who just got out of the fighter plane, said that the new J-10 fighter plane was highly automated, and that he not only felt very good flying in the air, he could even check his flight conditions on the computer any time after completing the flying course, in order to find out immediately the problems that occurred during the flight.The portable video playback system developed by the division can analyze details of the actions during the flight training at all times, giving people a feeling of "viewing all airspace maneuvers through one network and linking up with the earth and sky in one click.""Informationization brings both higher effect and benefit of quality," said Li Yong excitedly. To ensure that the first training of the new year runs smoothly, the division focused on the features of the new J-10 fighter planes and developed 14 training supervision systems for new planes, such as engine comprehensive intelligent supervision and quantitative analysis of important plane system parameters, and achieved new breakthroughs in commanding and training methods, as well as refining of training management, hence leading to an increase in the overall combat effectiveness of the troops.[1]
