January 31, 2007 10:23In recent years, two brothers in Germany named Karl Albrecht and Theo Albrecht have been listed among the richest people in Europe every year.Moreover, in the past ten-plus years, the two brothers also climbed steadily up the US Forbes' list of the richest people.Adforward Begin:Adforward EndAs a matter of fact, the two Albrecht brothers, who manage the "poor man's stores," Aldi (Aldi-Market) chain supermarkets, can be considered the richest in Germany.However, they hardly appear on media or in public, making it rather difficult for ordinary people to know what immense wealth means to them.Rose to Wealth with "Poor Man's Stores"The Albrecht brothers were born to a family of an ordinary miner in Germany.At that time, their father was working in a bakery, and their mother owned a little food store of 35 square meters in a residential area for miners in their hometown, Essen. The family had very meager income.After graduating from middle school, the two brothers, determined to change the financial situation of their family, each became apprentice at a food store owned by other people.However, World War II cut short the career they just started: Theo Albrecht went to Africa as a reservist, while Karl was sent to the war on the Eastern front as a regular.When World War II ended in 1946, the two brothers returned to their hometown and opened a food store.Their first batch of customers was, of course, local consumers who had little money and could not even afford adequate food and clothing.So, they sold butter at the lowest market price then, and sales was very good.Very soon, they set up branches near big supermarkets that had many customers.The two brothers simply gave up selling fresh food and concentrated on the sales of food that was easy to store and did not go bad within a short period of time.It did not take long for this idea of low-price discount store to be proven successful, with chain stores springing up like mushrooms in the Ruhr industrial region.By the late 1950s, they had more than 300 chain supermarkets, and the annual sales volume topped 100 million marks within a short period of time.In 1962, the first Aldi supermarket in the "real sense" opened in Dortmund. The name of the store "Aldi" was formed with the first two letters of the last name "Albrecht" (Albrecht) and the word "discount" (Discount).Compared with other stores, the greatest feature of the Aldi chain stores is its low prices. Even when converted to Renminbi, the prices of most goods are still very low relative to the income level of Chinese people today.When converted to Renminbi, the prices of some daily consumer items sold in the store throughout the year are, for instance, 1.80 yuan for one kilogram of flour, 3.50 yuan for a one-liter carton of pure apple juice, and three yuan for a one-liter carton of milk.Yet Germany has a per capita GNP of more than 20,000 US dollars.Right now, Aldi has a total of more than 6,000 outlets in 12 countries outside Germany, including the United States, and is expanding rapidly at the rate of opening up at least one new outlet every week.No wonder Forbes once exclaimed: If both the Albrecht brothers are not already more than 80 years old, in a few years they might surpass Gates to be the richest in the world.Cheap Things Can Be GoodAlthough "low prices" is what Aldi built itself upon, for Aldi to have grown rapidly and won large numbers of customers in the last decades in European countries and the US, where customers are extremely picky and competition is almost brutal, low prices are not the only thing it counts on.The Albrecht brothers know very well that doubt which accopanies people's love of cheap goods.Because of this, when Aldi procures goods, it always provides its own quality standards to its suppliers. Besides assigning its own staff to carry out inspection, the company also hires third-party inspection agencies to test the quality of goods.Once a product fails the spot inspection, it will be taken off the supply list without hesitation. The supplier will not only lose a large client, but also has to pay a huge sum of compensation.If dissatisfied with a product they've bought, customers don't need to state any reason and Aldi will refund the money.As Aldi has a high and stable demand, a manufacturer will definitely have an easy time once it is selected as its designated supplier.There is this saying circulating among suppliers: Fighting for the long-term supply contract with Aldi is as difficult as striving to qualify for Germany's Bundesliga; being forsaken by Aldi is worse than being betrayed by someone.In addition, different from many famous large-scale supermarkets in the world, Aldi chain supermarkets strictly control the number of their product varieties.At present, Aldi SÃ¼d chain supermarkets limit the supply of their goods to less than 600 varieties, whereas Aldi Nord chain supermarkets have below 750 varieties of goods.Here is the origin of this interesting practice: When the company first started in 1950, only a few products could be provided on the supply list. Based on the conditions at that time, only by keeping everything simple could further growth be ensured.The Albrecht brothers had planned to gradually increase the variety of goods, but they did not do so in the end.Because they realized when there was a small variety of goods, sales volume went up instead.Moreover, by doing this, the operation cost was much lower compared with similar food chain stores.Tracing back to 2002 when Germany and the West in general were suffering from a slow economy, but Aldi, the chain supermarket that targeted at poor people, was having exceptionally good days.The reason beneath this goes without saying: the worse the economic situation in society gets, the less money people will have in their pockets; and with less money in their pockets, people will have a greater need for quality goods at low prices.To Albrecht's mom, there is nothing simpler than this truth: "The tougher people's lives get, the easier our lives become." Today, what the two elderly brothers often think of is probably this famous saying of their mother.(Source: Shanghai Financial News, Writer: Fu Yemin)
