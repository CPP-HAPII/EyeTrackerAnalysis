(Source: Article of Xinhua News Agency, Dispatch time: January 18, 2007 17:02Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 18 (Reporter Wang Yi). Chongqing Yu Zhong District People's Procuratorate recently approved the arrest of eight people including Tang and Lin who posed as monks on suspicion of provoking fights.Investigations showed that these eight suspects were all peasants of Baofeng County, Henan Province. They shaved their heads and wore monk outfits to pose as monks and forcibly plastered self-made therapeutic substance on 'patients' with the excuse of free treatment and then collected 'therapeutic substance fee'.The suspects used this method to cheat people and provoke fights in Chongqing main city proper and Chengdu, Sichuan.At around 10 o'clock on November 17, 2006, at the victim Hong's home in a sub-district of Yu Zhong District, Chongqing City, Lin used the excuse to cure bronchitis to plaster self-made therapeutic substance on Hong's uncle and intended to swindle 20 yuan in cash. They got into a fight after Hong saw through his trick. Lin threatened to beat Hong's uncle to death outside. Hong thus started shuffling with Lin and caused injury to the corner of Lin's eye.Afterwards, Lin reported the injury to Zhang (handled in a separate case). Zhang thus gathered more than 30 monk members who scattered in nearby resident districts through broadcast. After handing out sticks to them, they were led back to Hong's residence by Lin and He.A dozen suspects including Tang crashed into Hong's home and smashed his things while the rest of the people waited downstairs to guard the intersection with sticks to prevent other people from passing through and helping. As a result, the furniture, doors, and windows at Hong's place were destroyed and Hong suffered minor injury.Several suspects also lifted the victim from upstairs to downstairs and intended to throw his into the river. They were stopped in time by the people's police who rushed to the scene.(The end)
