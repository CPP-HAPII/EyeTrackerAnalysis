March 8, 2008The Olympic torch relay is a prelude to the Olympics and is also the most important publicity tool next to the Olympics itself. Even more so, it's also a strong connection between the ancient Olympics and modern Olympics.All previous modern Olympic torch relays amply broadcast the Olympic spirit and transmitted a message of friendship and peace over the 100-day relay event as well as ignite passion of people for the Olympics.Just like the year the messenger announced the "Sacred Truce," today's torchbearers hold the Olympic torch in their hands and deliver the sacred Olympic flame to encourage citizens of the world to pursue the Olympic dream.In the place the ancient Olympics was held - Olympia, the sacred flame softly burned in the city's public hall in front of the altar of the goddess Hestia (Vesta in Greek mythology).The sacred flame here is similarly made through focusing light with a concave mirror. It is also used as the kindling to ignite sacred flames in other sacred places.Compared to the sacred flame relay of modern Olympics, the ancient pan-Greek Olympics never organized a torch relay or hand-held torch race.However, before the official competition started, a messenger wearing an olive branch crown on their head rushed about to each city and state to announce the precise time of the official start of the Olympics.They invited the citizens of all cities and states to come to Olympia and announced the start of the "Sacred Truce."The sacred flame relay of modern Olympics at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. That year, the sacred flame was collected at the Temple of Herain in the ancient ruins of Olympia in Greece, and soon after the torch relay was carried out.This tradition continues to today.There have already been 16 Summer Olympics that have held the sacred flame gathering ceremony here.Starting in 1964, the Winter Olympics also started the sacred flame gathering activity. Although it's also done at the ancient ruins of Olympia, the location where the sacred flame is gathered is different than that of the Summer Olympics. It's held in front of the monument for the modern Olympic father Coubertin.For 72 years, the Olympic torch relay has already become the Olympic host country's most powerful promotion activity for raising the public's awareness of the Olympics and publicity creation.The torch relay allows the citizens of the host country an opportunity to appreciate the power of the Olympics and also provides an opportunity for the host country and host city to promote themselves.
