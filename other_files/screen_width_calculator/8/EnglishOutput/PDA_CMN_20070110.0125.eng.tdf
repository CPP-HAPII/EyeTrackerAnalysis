January 8, 2007 09:04Liu Guosong and wife Li Mohua.Liu Guosong, 'Spokesman for Modern Wash Painting', has been occupying the vanguard position in Taiwan's painting circles for over 40 years. He was also the first person from Taiwan's literary circles to visit the mainland.This person is strong and has a sonorous voice. His forceful Shandong accent coming out with his unrestrained laugh, what a gain of initial advantage over others indeed!His work style is blunt and he does as he pleases. His wife denounces him as 'scatterbrained'!However, his wash paintings of landscape are either curling smoke and clouds or a calming moon in a sapphire sky. All wonders of nature are summoned effortlessly under his paintbrush. Their extensiveness is enough to embrace all creations on earth.Between the two extremes, I cannot determine which one is him - a loud voiced Shandong native or an unconventional painter?Chinese Paintings can Also be Drawn This WayHis wife said jokingly, "Liu Guosong is a missionary. His religion is modern wash painting". While Liu Guosong said, "I consider modern wash painting my primary life."Industry figures commented that the significance of Liu Guosong to the reform of Chinese wash paintings was his aggressive introduction of abstract expressionism of the mid-20th century and eventually filled a gap in the wash painting reform with a combined Chinese-Western reform proposal of blending Song's landscape pictures and abstract symbols, thus becoming a representing painter who goes beyond regions and of international significance."I started learning Chinese paintings when I was 14. I encountered Western paintings during my second year at the university. At that time, I found that compared to Western paintings, Chinese paintings were too remote from our times.As a result, I devoted all my efforts in creating Western paintings and took a 'completely Westernized' path.I spent seven years setting foot in various schools of Western paintings. However, later I found that it was wrong to continue this way," said Liu Guosong. "As a Chinese, my imitation of the West can only be superficial. We do not understand Western tradition. What we believe is new is precisely the old for the West."Liu Guosong felt lost and painful after his realization. "We have 5,000 years of culture and solid tradition. How could I look on passively while Chinese paintings declined?"We cannot deny the noumenon of Chinese paintings." As a result, Liu Guosong shouted 'We need to revolutionize the traditional brush stroke". He put forward the modernization of Chinese paintings and suggested that Chinese paintings should reflect our real life and be different from the ones created by the forefathers.In the mid 60's of the last century, Liu Guosong sold his fist painting for US $90."We were ecstatic at that time.Soon after, I had the first painting exhibition in the United States. I sold 27 of the 29 paintings and each cost more than US $200.This was quite a bit of money at that time." Liu Guosong was excited when talking about his experiences.Since 1965, Liu Guosong has held over 100 personal painting exhibitions and taken part in over 100 international group exhibitions at the invitation of art galleries and museums around the world, as well as received several special honors.Over 50 galleries and museums in the world have collected his works.In 1998, in the major exhibition titled 'China: 5,000 Years' held by the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, the only Taiwanese painter invited was Liu Guosong.God Saves Me an EarLiu Guosong was the first person from the Taiwan literary circles to visit the mainland after the two sides of the Strait ceased contact in 1949.Liu Guosong took part in his first painting exhibition in China in 1981."I did it covertly at that time and did not want to make it known. However, once I returned to Taiwan, I received a call from a painter friend in Taipei asking, 'I heard that you went to Beijing?'I then thought that even my friends knew about it, then Taiwan authorities must have known, might as well press my luck."I later gladly accept the continuous invitations from the mainland.Since breaking through the obstacles to visit the mainland in the early 80's of the last century, Liu Guosong visits the mainland almost every year and can be considered as a hardworking envoy of the art circles in the two sides of the Strait.He played the role of a 'relay station' while he was living in Hong Kong by helping friends in the mainland and Taiwan to send letters to each other and arrange for meetings.He also introduced a renowned painter of the mainland in every issue of the 'Cover Figure' of the Wenxing magazine in Taiwan.The mainland experiences also left Liu Guosong with happy memories.When Liu Guosong was 68 years old, the Tibet University invited him to go there to give lectures."I was thinking that I must take a look of the snowy mountain.A young painter named Bamazhaxi who was born and raised in Tibet accompanied me. Before I went up, people had warned me not to stay too long on the mountain. The most I could stay was for half an hour.When I climbed up the mountain and saw the snowy mountain glowed under the sunlight and the white clouds floating at the mountainside, it was breathtaking.I was extremely excited about this beautiful scene that was hardly seen on earth and forgot about the time. I stayed there for three and a half hours before I came down!" Liu Guosong said with a smile, "When I returned to Xigaze, my wife was shocked because my head was so swollen from the air pressure that I looked like a big-headed doll.It was indeed secondary. When we returned to Lhasa and arrived in the plane at Chengdu, I suddenly lost my hearing in my left ear. I sought treatment from many places and still could not cure it so I simply gave up."Liu Guosong laughed and said, "I feel that God treats me well by allowing me to see such beautiful scenery and leave me with an ear.I decided not to cure it.From then on, all aspects of life become normal on the contrary."This Husband is NaughtyIn the reporter's eyes, the already 74-years-old Liu Guosong is a particularly lovely old urchin. His round head glitters, his eyes form a crescent moon when he smiles, and his loud voice is sonorous.While dining with him at the same table, his straight voice resonated and overpowered voices of all guests in the entire hall.However, the casual Liu Guosong also has his attentive side. He always helped his wife to the food first during the meal, which won high praise from the reporter.However, his wife said in anger, "Don't mention it. He gives me the food that I don't like every time." Liu Guosong defended, "She is fuzzy about her food."His wife said, "He drives fast. He is so old and still acts like a 'hooligan'. Liu Guosong refuted, "I drive fast because I am afraid that I will fall asleep."His wife has always been surprised that he never worries that failure will bring him shame."If I try my best, it does not matter if I fail.If I think twice before taking actions, then I will not act in full force." Liu Guosong of course has his theory.His wife said, "I have the best temper among the people at home. I am particularly sweet but dealing with person like him, I cannot help but to use 'force'.Sometimes he is really scatterbrained." Liu Guosong added proudly, "Sometimes when we fight, I do not take it seriously and forget about it after a while. I fall asleep soundly when I go to bed at night. Never have I expected that she is still angry and kicks me off the bed."His wife said, "He is particularly hospitable but he seldom informs me, thus catching me on the hop.One time, I saw a large group of his students standing at the door when I opened it, 'Mrs. Liu, Mr. Liu invited us here for dinner.'I almost passed out right then and there.The excellent cooking skills that I have now were trained at that time."His wife told the secret by saying, "Although he is always laughing, in fact, he particularly likes to cry.He often cries his eyes out when watching television by himself. The entire family was baffled.We later learned that he thinks about his poor mother and his hardscrabble life when he was small. Thus, he feels as if he experiences it in person."His wife added, "He never fears being stony broke." One time there was a typhoon. The windows were open. All the things at home were soaked and became useless. Even the blanket was wet.I then cried, 'Where can we sleep?'He made nothing of it and said, 'It's all right that we lost the things.I have had nothing since I was small. I am not afraid of not owning a thing in the world.'""You had suffered, Aunt," the reporter felt very sorry for her. However, his wife smiled, "Even though we were poor during those days, I was very happy to be with him."This Father is a Bit StubbornAs for his own marriage, Liu Guosong said, "I believe in destiny very much." Liu Guosong was admitted to the School for the Family of the Deceased Kuomintang Revolutionary Army in Nanjing when he was 16.The Director of the school council was precisely his future father-in-law.One time, Liu Guosong was elected as the Students' Meal Committee. He was ignorant at that time and did not know that the money had depreciated that much. He only knew that the food tasted horrible. As a result, he went to argue with the Director of the school council."+Her father disliked me very much." Liu Guosong is still embarrassed when he thinks about it now."When my wife and I courted, I had to brace myself to go to her house to play up to my father-in-law. Nothing venture, nothing gain!Once I came to the point, +her father immediately said 'Stop' and that 'There were so many students that you could pick but you picked the one that I dislike the most.'As a result, I was booted out of the house." Liu Guosong described it vividly."Fortunately, my mother-in-law had faith in me.Tell him the way mother-in-law liked me." Liu Guosong wanted to feed his vanity through his wife's mouth.His wife said with a smile, "My mother said, 'This child is very smart. He will have a bright future.'" Later when they got married, even though his father-in-law did not attend, when he visited his in-laws with his newly wed wife, his father-in-law's attitude changed immediately. "He had been extremely good to me ever since." Liu Guosong said delightedly.When his own daughter was looking for a boyfriend, Liu Guosong played the role of his father-in-law in those years. He actually threw away the flowers that his daughter's boyfriend gave her."It is because all fathers believe that no one is good enough for their daughters." Liu Guosong said laughingly."You have painted for the entire life. Do you have any other plan in the future?" The reporter asked with a smile."I want to paint until 95 years old!" Liu Guosong said loudly. "I have to leave five years to rest." No sooner had he finished speaking than his wife turned and walked away, leaving he and the reporter looked at each other and laughed heartily.
