Bangkok (AFP), 20th.Today, Thai Prime Minister Samak said that Thai people should be patient with rising rice prices, because the price of rice repeatedly reaching new highs is beneficial to poor farmers.In his weekly speech to the whole country, Samak said: "If everybody can make some sacrifices, pay a bit more when buying rice - just a little more, not very much - this will be beneficial to farmers."The Thai Rice Exporters Association's investigative report on rice prices pointed out that on April 9th, the export price of Thailand's fragrant rice was 956 US Dollars per metric ton, approximately 50% higher than a month ago.Fragrant rice is Thailand's main rice strain.After Vietnam and India, two important rice exporting countries, limited rice exports in order to ensure domestic supply, the international market's demand for Thai rice greatly increased.Under the powerful pressure of export demands, the domestic price of rice in Thailand rose correspondingly.Samak said that the government understands that the rise in food and fuel prices brings stress to ordinary Thai families. He guaranteed once more that the government will try to find a way to increase people's income.However, Samak didn't elaborate further on relevant details.
