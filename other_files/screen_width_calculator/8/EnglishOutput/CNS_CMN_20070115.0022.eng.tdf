Compared with that of the last Party Congress, the difference ratio has increased by 1.8% to 25.7%.- The quotas of members of provincial Party committees and disciplinary committees are appropriately increased, and the composition is further optimized.The quotas of Party committee members and alternate members elected in the 14 provinces and regions have increased by 36.6% on average compared with the previous term.After increase of the quotas, the chief Party and government responsible persons of the municipalities (regions, prefectures) in the jurisdiction of the 14 provinces and regions as well as the chief qualified responsible persons of the main departments of the provincial Party committees and governments have all been included into Party committees. This has better reflected the requirement of the Central Committee to further improve the Party committee composition and created important conditions for the National Congress to further fully play its role.Meanwhile, the quotas of members of the disciplinary committees in the 14 provinces and regions increased by 24.6% compared with last time, facilitating the disciplinary committees to better play their roles.During the process of election, the difference ratios of candidates and seats for Party committee members, alternate members, and disciplinary committee members in the 14 provinces and regions are all higher than 10%, and the difference ratio of candidates and seats for alternate Party committee members is 11.3% on average.The difference ratio of candidates and seats for disciplinary committee members is 11.8%.- The smooth election has produced a powerful and new leadership team of provincial and regional Party committees and disciplinary committees.All the provinces and regions have conducted full research on the working schemes of the Party Congress, distribution of representative quotas, election methods, and meeting agendas, paid attention to deepening and careful ideological and political work to ensure careful organization and arrangement of the Party Congress as well as united and encouraging meetings.Judging from the outcomes of the elections, the make-up of the leadership teams in the 14 provinces and regions has further strengthened the force of reform, which has created conditions for further expansion of inner-Party democracy and implementation of the system of labor division and responsibility assumed by standing committee members.The number of positions in the new Party committee leadership teams of the 14 provinces and regions is somewhat reduced. There are 186 standing committee members in total, 8 persons fewer than the last term.The number of deputy secretaries of Party committees is reduced. There are 33 deputy secretaries of Party committees, 38 persons fewer than the last term.Cross-appointment of Party and government positions is somewhat increased. Thirty-nine persons cross hold positions, and the average number is increased from 2.3 to 2.8 persons per province compared with the last term.In addition, the leadership team composition is further optimized.The average age of Party standing committee members is 52.7, 0.5 year younger than at the last term; there are 56 persons under 50 years old, of which 21 persons are around 45 years old. The Party committee leadership teams of most provinces and regions have at least 1 female cadre, with some provinces having two.In ethnic minority regions such as Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Tibet and Xinjiang, the ethnic minority cadres have reached a certain proportion.It is learned that the preparation of cadre evaluation and election for Party committee reshuffle to be conducted in 17 provinces, regions, and municipalities this year is in smooth progress.(Li Yajie)
