January 15, 2007 05:12The retail benchmark price for gas across the nation was lowered by 220 yuan per ton starting at 00:00 on January 14.It had been exactly nine days between the announcement of this public-spirited decision and the speech made by heads of China National Petroleum Corporation, China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation to the media that said "The price of domestic product oil is still low compared to the international one".Another public-spirited decision that attracted wide attention was that railway ticket price for passenger transport during the Spring Festival will not be increased starting 2007.As we can see, the central government does not turn a blind eye to the over-protection of high prices and failure to perform public duties to their best by some monopolized industries but exerts itself to adopt regulatory measures instead.The aim of the regulations is to realize the integration of market operation and the function to perform public services of monopolized industries.On the one hand, major spheres such as resources and transportation have public service properties, thus they should maintain relatively stable prices. On the other hand, in order to increase the service efficiency of these spheres, certain market mechanisms should also be implemented in their operations to encourage appropriate competitions.I believe that the so-called 'relative integration of market operation and public service functions' should be the integration of market economy and public morals, as well as the integration of economic operational efficiency and the purpose to serve people.The two public-spirited decisions and the direct intervention of the Minister of Railways in the 'trivial matter' as food price violation in the dining coach (In the end of last year, the Minister of Railways instructed the Wuhan passenger line to refund a passenger the extra 20 yuan that they charged him and apologize) made me think of Lei Feng who 'did many good deeds on the train' during his train ride on his way to conduct business.How would this good man who always had other people in mind and helped others view the prices of railway tickets and service issues under current market economy conditions?Let's further imagine, how would Lei Feng strike a balance between the travel needs of people and the loss and gain of the railway if he were the Minister of Railways?How should people's moral factors integrate with market economy?I think the chiefs of monopolized service departments should have the heart to devote themselves wholeheartedly to serve the people and to do their utmost to establish a low-cost and good service basic transportation system based on the convictions of 'power to the people, feelings with the people, and benefits for the people'.Even when face with the pressure of increased raw material price and inadequate service capacity, when considering price change, they should first lower the 'intangible' cost through improving management and tapping internal latent potentials instead of merely raising the price.We stress moral constraints in public service sector but it does not mean that we do not need market mechanism or we want to change railway transportation into free benefits.Most of Lei Feng's good deeds in those years were done at his own expense.If public services nowadays are provided free, even draining the money of the State will not be enough.However, if ministers of public service sector casually use price rule to argue, not only have ticket and oil prices continued to rise, even an ordinary dish such as Chinese cabbage with cloud ears stir fry cost 16 yuan when it is sold on the train, I am afraid that it has gone too far.This situation is after all, linked to the large backdrop of the weak public service consciousness that monopolized industries have.Not only does this problem happen in railway, it also happens in civil aviation.If Lei Feng were the Minister of Railways, he might try his best to prevent ticket price from going up during the Spring Festival and severely punish trains that sell high-priced food.If he were only a soldier, then when he discovered the high-priced Chinese cabbage stir fry while helping dining coach attendants sell food, he would certainly report the situation according to procedures or debate with the attendants and train chief, he might even seek support from the media.I also heard some explanations that seemed aggrieved in the debate of railway price during the Spring Festival. Some said that the price increase plays a regulatory role and it eventually benefits the people while some said that even the railway increases its income during the Spring Festival, its cost increases more.I do not doubt that some original intentions of the initial price increase are good. However, there are some weak spots in the abovementioned arguments: 1. The direct result of a price increase is increased income for the monopolized department and more money paid by passengers. It is far-fetched to say that this is to "encourage the forming of a fair and orderly competitive environment in the transportation market"; 2. Reasons for increase in cost and waste in transport capacity during the Spring Festival should be sought more from the management instead of considering passengers as a drag; 3. Even if the passenger flow is a burden and passengers should bear some cost for traveling during peak period, as the main transport channel, it is perfectly justifiable for railway to perform certain public duties.What do enterprises use the profits they accumulated all these years for?Even pure market sectors repay debt to those on whom their livelihood relies all the time, let alone public service department.When is a better time than the Spring Festival to repay the debt?As a State's monopolized industry, the profit of the railway itself belongs to all the people.It is only natural that they take a portion of it out to subsidize passenger transport during the Spring Festival.Moderate monopoly in public service sector is to serve people while taking the opportunity to make profits is not only immoral and should be punished as well.
