January 30, 2007 10:50Chinanews.com, London, January 30. A British suspected terrorist said during a court trial on the 29th that extreme Muslims inside Britain are stepping up their plotting efforts and will soon launch another suicide terrorist attack similar to the July 7 subway bombings.British intelligence official also confirmed the possibility of another attack on London subway.The Old Bailey Court in London, Britain resumed on the 29th to try a 31-year-old terrorist suspect Abdul Saleem.Abdul Saleem roared in the court, "You will pay the price. A second suicide attack similar to the July 7 subway bombings is brewing.Bin Laden is taking action. He may even seek refuge in Britain."Peter Clark, anti-terrorist official of Britain's MI5, said during an interview with reporters that latest intelligence intercepted indicated that the most influential extreme Muslims in Britain had held a secret meeting to prepare to launch another terrorist attack on London subway or other public facilities similar to the July 7 bombings.Clark said, "Since the Iraq situation continues to deteriorate, some Muslim communities in Britain have growing sympathy for terrorism.With the steadily increasing pressure of terrorist threat, we want to warn people that besides being vigilant against Muslim extremists, they should also be aware of retaliatory acts from non-Muslim communities.If terrorist attacks happen, then women who wear a veil should not go out alone. Mosques and Islamic schools should install centralized television monitoring system."During the interview, Clark claimed that Britain's MI5 and the British police both believed that many Muslims in Britain will directly or indirectly support terrorism. The possibility of supporting terrorist acts is even higherThese British Muslims who are involved with Pakistan always use the opportunities to visit relatives to contact terrorists or extreme religious figures who recruit them as 'Jihad warriors' of terrorist organizations.These Muslims will be the key monitoring targets of Britain's intelligence agencies and the police.Clark said, "Since the 9/11 terrorist attack in the United States, there had been several terrorist attacks inside Britain as well.Investigations showed that most of the terrorist attacks happened inside Britain were not initiated by overseas terrorists entering Britain but planned and carried out by British home-grown terrorists. The threats mainly come from inside Britain.I do not want to talk too much about the number of Muslims being monitored here. It is insignificant.What I want to say is that according to my knowledge, there are several thousand Muslims who are persons of interest for the MI5 and us.This number includes various Muslim figures. It is not limited to terrorists or attackers but include Muslims who try to provide support or encouragement to the terrorists."In order to step up the surveillance of Muslims inside the nation, the British Parliament passed a bill to approve a major expansion of the MI5 responsible for domestic intelligence. Its annual budget will be increased to around Â£400 million.This will enable the number of MI5 intelligence agents to double by 2009 and expand to nearly 4,000 people from the 2,000 before.In addition, Britain's MI5 will also secretly recruit several hundred spies, surveillance agents, and office workers, many young minority Muslims will be among the recruitees.The MI5 also plans to recruit young Muslims who have street experiences and can infiltrate into extreme Muslim organizations in order to keep abreast of relevant movements of these extreme organizations in advance.Official of Britain's Home Office responsible for security affairs stated that Britain is still under serious threats from extreme Muslim terrorists. The police and the MI5 are monitoring at least five suspicious terrorist groups.Allegedly, these Muslim groups are planning to launch independent terrorist attacks against British and overseas targets.British Home Secretary indicated last week that he is very concerned about the intelligence mentioned in the daily briefing from the MI5.He said that since the London subway bombings in 2005, the British intelligence department and the police have jointly foiled two major terrorist attack plots and some of the suspects responsible for plotting the attacks are currently on trial.(Bi Yuan)
