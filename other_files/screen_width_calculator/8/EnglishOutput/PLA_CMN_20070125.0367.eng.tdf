From having to accept being a runner-up for six consecutive times in those years to being crowned world champion the second time on the 24th, Chang Hao unlocked his thoughts after the tournament and revealed the several 'changes' and 'constants' in his eyes.(Subheading) Change: Different from the Winning in the Ing CupThe winning of the Samsung Cup this time was apparently different from the winning of the Ing Cup in 2005.Chang Hao said, "That was my first world title and this is the second. I beat Cui Zhehan last time and Li Changho this time.I am extremely happy that I defeated Li Changho in the finals. This is a result that I have longed for."(Subheading) Change: Li Changho in Poor Shape, His State of Mind More StableChang Hao boiled down his winning to two factors: Li Changho was in poor condition and his personal state of mind was stable.He said, "Judging from these two games of chess, Li Changho was not in very good condition and made more mistakes.As for myself, I have been in good shape since last September and my state of mind has been rather good.There were many loopholes in these two games of chess that require analyzing. However, my state of mind is more stable than it was a few years ago."(Subheading) Constant: Li Changho is Still Top World Go Player"Li Changho's condition is undergoing an adjustment process. Once the adjustment is completed, he will even be better than before." For Chang Hao, Li Changho is still the top world Go player.He stated, "He started being champion since he was 15, 16 years old and has won over 100 so far. It is rare.Now, on the one hand, he needs to adjust his condition, on the other hand, young players also exert huge pressure.However, he may adjust to a more fearful state."(Subheading) Constant: Li Changho and I Appreciate Each Other after TournamentsAfter the first game on the 22nd, Chang Hao and Li Changho gathered and drank to their hearts' content.This pair of opponents who have been competing for 10 years are good friends after the tournaments. This is widely known in the Go circle.Chang Hao stated, "Some net friends considered this tournament my 'battle of revenge' and compared me to the Yue's Emperor Gou Jian.Actually, I think my relationship with Li Changho is more like Li Yunlong and Chu Yunfei in Shiny Sword.We do our best to compete in the tournaments for our dreams.However, after the tournaments, we do not harbor hatred but appreciate each other instead.Li Changho is a very good person. He has indeed left us with many fabulous tournaments."In his responses to the reporters' questions, Chang Hao mentioned several times of his own accord, "I want to encounter Li Changho in more finals in the future."
