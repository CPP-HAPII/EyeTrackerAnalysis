Cheng Yawen, January 7, 2007From now on till 2050, China's population will not always keep increasing, but will go through a process of initial increase, followed by decrease.The 2006 world population statistics of the US Population Reference Bureau show that among the top ten countries with the highest population, China ranks first with 1.31 billion. However, the interesting thing is that it also forecasts that in 2050, China's population will only increase by slightly more than 100 million to reach 1.44 billion, making it second in the world right after India.On the other hand, in the latest World Population Prospectus published by the United Nations, it is forecasted that China's population by 2050 will be 1.39 billion.These two forecasts are rather thought-provoking.China's population is currently still on the rise. It is generally estimated that in another 20 years, which is about 2026, China's population will reach a peak of about 1.5 billion.If China's population is 1.44 billion, or lower at 1.39 billion by 2050, this will mean that from now on until 2050, China's population will not always keep increasing but will go through a process of initial increase, followed by decrease.This estimate is, of course, based on the current fertility level of the Chinese people.From a long-term perspective, whether the population of a country can increase or not depends on its total fertility rate.Only when the total fertility rate reaches 2.1-2.2, which means a woman of the right age gives birth to at least two children on average in her lifetime, can the need for generation replacement be maintained so as to prevent the total population from falling.Judging from the results of the two national population censuses as well as all kinds of other statistical information obtained since the 90s of the last century, China's fertility rate is now significantly lower than the generation replacement level.The figure announced by the relevant department is 1.8. Even when based on this figure, it is still lower than the 2.0 of the United States and even lower than the 2.3 of India.On the other hand, the results of the fifth population census in 2000 show that if the "non-declared" group of 24.2 million people, who aroused much controversy, was not counted, the total fertility rate of our country in 2000 would only be 1.22. This is far from the 2.1-2.2 needed for the generation replacement level. This surprised the demographic scholars, departments in charge of birth control, and even the public.However, many local demographic scholars and relevant research institutes believe that this figure has a high validity.Various objective data show that after the mid 90s of the last century, the total fertility rate of mainland Chinese women has become lower than 1.3 to be at the same level as that of Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and the Taiwan region of China.And in the 70s of the last century, this figure was 6.0. At that time, China was in a birth peak.However, since the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the total fertility rate of Chinese women has been lower than the generation replacement level.Since a long time ago, the phenomenon of men and women of appropriate age in major Chinese cities having low desire to give birth and a low actual fertility rate is actually no longer a secret, but a fact known to all.However, many people probably still do not expect that the birth concept of the rural population has also experienced drastic changes in about the last 20 years.People who are familiar with rural life know that in these years, the number of rural elementary schools and high schools keeps decreasing, with some closing down and some merging.This is a clear proof that the new birth population in Chinese villages is falling rapidly.In many regions in China's countryside, it is already very common to have one child per family; on the contrary, it is rare to see a family raising more than two children.The above situation also causes China to quickly go from the second type of population replacement to the third population type.This means that only in about 30 years, has it made a transition to the low-birth, low-death, and low-growth in the 90s of the 20th century, after China's population changed from the conventional high-birth, high-death, and low-growth to high-birth, low-death, and high-growth in the 50s and 60s of the last century.Out of China's 1.3 billion population today, almost 0.6 billion live in cities and 0.7 billion live in the countryside.With today's urbanization rate below 50%, population replacement in China is totally different from that in the 80s of the last century.What can be predicted is that with China's course of industrialization and urbanization still being accelerated forward, the birth concept of Chinese people in the future will not be the same and the fertility rate will also continue to fall constantly, no matter what adjustments are made to the population policies.Just as what is said by Professor Qiao Xiaochun of Peking University, "After a country enters the industrialization stage, it is possible to bring down the fertility rate, but it is not quite possible to increase the fertility rate that has already been low for a long time."The experience of countries such as Japan, Russia, and South Korea has already proven this point.Without doubt, this is reminding people that the population problem faced by China in the future is no longer only population increase.Based on the current fertility rate, China's population will start to experience negative growth in less than 20 years.What will be the extent of the negative growth?If the fertility rate of 1.22 of China's population found out by the 2000 population census is accurate, even if we do not consider a possible further drop in fertility rate and simply go according to this figure, China's population by 2050 will even be at least 100 million lower than that of the forecasts of the United States and the United Nations.There is actually some clues now as to what new problems it will bring.For instance, since the year before last, many factories along the coast of Zhejiang and Guangdong no longer have enough laborers coming to apply for jobs. At first, it was thought that this phenomenon was only regional, but people only realized last year and this year that many places in China have this problem too.In the past twenty-plus years, China has always been worried about the overly fast population growth.However, in another about 20 years, China will experience a reverse trend of negative growth.Facing such a situation, how should we reconsider China's population issue and current population policies?
