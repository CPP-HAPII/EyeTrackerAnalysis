Lu Zhijian, January 10, 2007Starting from yesterday after the three-day holiday, taxpayers who earn more than 120,000 yuan per year can file their tax declaration at the competent local tax authority where their workplace or employer is located.The correspondent found out yesterday at the hall of Tianhe District Tax Office of the Guangzhou Local Tax Bureau that although the publicity materials for the various personal income tax declarations have been fully set up, there were very few citizens who came to file tax declarations. There was almost no one who came for the "120,000 yuan self-declaration."(January 5, Xinhuanet)According to the relevant regulations of the "Measures for Self-Declaration of Personal Income Tax" announced recently by the State Tax Bureau, five categories of taxpayers, including those who earn more than 120,000 yuan per year and those who receive a salary from two or more than two places within China, need to declare information such as annual income within three months after the end of the tax year.However, even though Guangzhou did a large amount of initial preparation for the first day of the personal income tax declaration, the embarrassment of having zero declarations on the first day still makes people shocked and ponder.In an interview by the correspondent, a Ms. Wong said that she could not fill out the form even if she had wanted to declare, because she has never had the habit of keeping accounts and it was very difficult to, all at once, calculate how much exactly her annual income was.The correspondent found out that due to various reasons, many people who meet the "120,000 yuan annual income" criterion are keeping a wait-and-see attitude toward the personal income tax self-declaration.This is excusable if it is really like what Ms. Wong has said.After all, such a declaration is built on the morality, discipline, tax awareness, and tax honesty of the citizens. It is also a normal phenomenon to hesitate and wait and see when it involves "privacy" of the citizens about their income.However, the problem is, what is really scary behind this wait-and-see is if those rich people have no intention to declare taxes or no tax consciousness at all.Although the law on administration of tax collection clearly stipulates that if a person whose income reaches 120,000 yuan fails to file a tax declaration within the declaration deadline, he or she needs to bear corresponding legal responsibilities, such as being fined between 2,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan, with the highest fine at 50,000 yuan.The prerequisite of "self-declaration" is the self-discipline of the taxpayers, rather than compulsory means.In other words, it is to use the power of morality in impelling the high-income group to repay the society.This obviously lacks enough restraint and deterrence on some rich people who are still not used to paying taxes voluntarily. As such, rich people are always associated with tax evasion, tax avoidance, tax dodging, and tax negligence.In recent years, we publish a top 100 taxpayers list every year, and whenever we analyzed the top 100 taxpayers list against another renowned list--the richest people list published by the Forbes magazine--we would always be shocked to discover a huge contrast between the two, which is, the top 100 richest people list and the taxpayers list are very much opposite of each other.Sixty-five percent of the personal income taxes come from salaried workers. This is a very typical proof of how some rich people are "mean" and "stingy" in contributing to the society.It is the obligation of every natural person and legal person to pay taxes according to law.As such, judging from the zero personal income tax declarations on the first day in Guangzhou, we hope that this is only "wait-and-see," rather than the tax unawareness of a whole group.
