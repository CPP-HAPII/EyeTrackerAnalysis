He said, "Chinese women's road cycling has made remarkable progress in recent years and is expected to bring a pleasant surprise in the Beijing Olympic Games."At the press conference held after the competition, Peterson said, "Since the 1980s, I have led teams into contests in Asia and other places. At that time, Chinese teams were rarely seen on the international competition terrain.Things have changed now. We can see them in almost every leg of competition."As Peterson sees it, the achievements made by the Chinese cyclists are inseparable from Shen Jinkang, the coach of the Giant Team in Hong Kong, China."Shen (Jinkang) is a very good coach. Under his leadership, the Chinese cyclists have made rapid progress and learned to attack."In competitions, they always find the right opportunity to attack, attack and attack again through teamwork, which dragged down our team members".Under the regulations of the International Cycling Union, the top 16 teams in the world will have three quotas for participation in the Olympic Games.Peterson said that South African team now ranks 16th, close behind the Chinese team."I hope that both teams can have three members for the Olympic Games. Of course I hope that our team members will win," Peterson said with a smile. (End)2008/04/29 19:44 .
