Apr. 18, 2008(People.com.cn, Apr. 18) According to a report by TVS, US Ambassador to Guatemala Derham acknowledged yesterday that 450 tonnes of Columbian cocaine are transported to the US each year, most of the drugs being transported there through Central America.Derham said the US had spent USD50 million this year to prevent drug trafficking in the region and that next year the investment would double.He admitted that because drug trafficking is an illegal business, combatting it is a serious and complicated task.Last week, the Guatemalan security organization seized almost 1.5 tonnes of cocaine within the space of three days in the northern state of Pet√©n on the border of Mexico and Belize, dealing a heavy blow to drug-trafficking gangs.
