KUWAIT CITY, 20th (AFP)The president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Khelil, said today that because the oil market is in an excellent state of balance, OPEC member states do not need to increase production.Kuwait News Agency reported that Khelil said, "For the moment, OPEC member states do not need to increase production.Because supply and demand are balanced, increasing production will not influence the price of oil."Khelil, the Algerian energy minister, is currently accompanying the Algerian president on a visit to Kuwait.He added,"Last year we increased production, but prices kept on climbing.If we increase production again, we won't be able to find buyers for the additional oil we produce."At close of the New York oil market yesterday, light crude for May delivery hit a record high of US$116/barrel, US$1.83 higher than the previous trading day. At one point during the session, the barrel hit a record US$117/barrel.However, Khelil also said, OPEC's thirteen oil-producing countries have the capacity to increase production by two million barrels a day.
