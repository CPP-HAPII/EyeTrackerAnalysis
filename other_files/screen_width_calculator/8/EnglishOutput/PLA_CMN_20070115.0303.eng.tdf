The goal is to snatch a gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Yet, there are only less than 300 professional trap shooting players across China, thus it puts the head coach of the national trap shooting team Sun Shengwei in a rather strained circumstances in talent selection.Sun Shengwei said that currently, only approximately half of the provinces, regions, and cities in China have trap shooting teams with less than 300 professional players.As a result, he quite envies the 'big brother' - the national rifle pistol team."A national secondary school students' rifle pistol shooting tournament in Shanghai alone had more than 400 players took part and their standards were high."While in overseas, trap is even a popular sport.Sun Shengwei stated that trap sport has been launched in Europe for over a century. Trap shooting has been listed as an official competition event since the 2nd Olympic Games.Every Italian city has a trap shooting range and competition is held every weekend.In France, there are over four hundred thousand trap club members alone.Amateur trap enthusiasts are very few in our nation.It creates huge inconvenience for talent selection for the trap team.Even so, China's trap event still maintains top standard in Asia and relatively high standard in the world.Sun Shengwei argued that in order to minimize the disadvantages brought about by the narrow talent selection range, it requires the heightening of training quality by scientific training, the effective prolonging of sports life of veteran athletes, and the acceleration of the speed for young potential athletes to become valuable.Sun Shengwei claimed that veteran players including Hu Binyuan, Qu Ridong, and Wei Ning are still maintaining high competitive standard.Among which, the standard of men's double trap athlete Hu Binyuan has stabilized. He entered the top three in all five world-class competitions in 2006. His standard is almost on a par with those of the few world top players from Russia, India, and the United Arab Emirates.In women's double trap, Wei Ning's results of this year have a slightly 'downward' trend. She missed a few chances during the additional games in the Asian Games and lost the gold medal.However, as long as the 'flaws' in her thinking and mentality can be fixed, she is still hopeful to win the gold medal in the Beijing Olympics.Young and potential players should be discovered and trained at an early stage and major competition selection system should be implemented within the team to create opportunities for young players to come to the fore.Sun Shengwei said that innovative measures should be adopted in training for the Olympics.First, dual training should be considered as drills for basic techniques. Second, the mental qualities of team members should be heightened. Certain extreme training methods should be attempted to enable athletes to have the ability to conquer extreme fear so they will fight to survive in the competitions. Third, coaches of overseas strong teams such as Russia should be invited to pass on their valuable experiences to improve the standard of domestic coaches.A base of less than 300 professional athletes is indeed too small. However, one ought to be good at making something out of limited resources.Reclaiming the gold medal in the Olympics has been the wish of the Chinese trap team since Sichuan lady Zhang Shan created the miracle of shooting 200 out of 200 targets at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992.(The end)
