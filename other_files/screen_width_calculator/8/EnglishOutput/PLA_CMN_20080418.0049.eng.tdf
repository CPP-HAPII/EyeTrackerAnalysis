Everything was up and running in just three months' time.Reporters at the Fuyuan county's PAP squadron noticed that officers and soldiers could obtain all kinds of information right before their eyes at the click of a mouse.Yang Lidong, the political instructor of the squadron, said: "With the 'Internet culture rooms,' the officers and soldiers study more conveniently and live more enriched lives."
