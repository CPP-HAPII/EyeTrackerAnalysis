January 23, 2007 14:14Not too long ago, television documentary Rise of Major Powers was broadcast with great popularity. Fellow countrymen had indeed learned many things and broadened their horizon. It also led to people's realization of the extreme importance in having political and military planning and control of the sea.Ancient Roman politician Cicero once said, "He who rules the sea rules the world." The progenitor of the Sea Power Theory Mahan argued that the determining factor in the rise and fall of all empires lies in whether they have strong sea power and whether they can control the sea.Given the rise of international major powers in history, we can say that they were all closely related to having political and military planning and control of the sea. Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States all 'commenced at the sea' and eventually became nations that possess strong ability to exercise control of the sea.The center of global economy is currently shifting toward the sea. With the heating up in the tapping of maritime resources, struggles for maritime rights and control among nations in the world are intensifying.The United States considers "control of the 16 strategic maritime passages in the world" a big part of its naval strategy and continues to strengthen the military presence in these regions.The Japanese Self-Defense troops also suggest explicitly the need to protect the maritime 'thousand-mile-long lifeline'.While the Indian navy put forward the combat ideology of 'annihilation of enemies from long-distance sea' to achieve 'the Indian Ocean Control Strategy'.For our nation, we have huge strategic interests in maritime space whether it is in advancing economic developments or in protecting national security.However, on the contrary, due to the influence of traditional land boundary concept and modern times closed-door and forbidden sea policies, the maritime concept of all our nationals has long been relatively weak. People always attach importance to the land and neglect the sea.As a result, in face of the need for interests of the nation's economic developments and the complicated maritime struggles, we must establish a firm 'blue territory' concept.As the defender of the nation's and the people's interests, it is even more important for the People's Army to understand maritime strategies from the perspective of the nation's overall strategies. They should foster new maritime territory concept, maritime interest concept, and maritime defense concept; to perform faithfully the historical mission of our army in the new century and the new phase; and to continuously heighten the ability to defend our nation's maritime territory and maritime interests so as to provide strategic support for the safeguard of our nation's interests.The 21st century is the maritime century. The 21st century is also the century of the rise of the Chinese nation.Only if we continue to enhance our maritime awareness and maritime concept with pressing urgency and to plan and gain political and military control of the sea and defend maritime rights with the strategic thinking of establishing a major maritime power can we bring about the rise of the Chinese nation in the end.â˜…(PLA Daily, January 23, 2007, 11th edition)
