Bi Wenzhang 2007-01-20A warrant was issued on December 30, 2006, by the supervisory department for the official arrest of Yang Hua, legal representative of Chongqing Lixin Finance Academy, on suspicion of fraud.The facts gradually emerged after a penetrating investigation by the public security department: he concealed the nature of the school, enrolled over 350 "bachelor degree" students, and made over 3.37 million yuan in profits.And the case revealed some systemic and regulatory loopholes which are thought-provoking.However, by the time the public security department opened the investigation into this case, over 3 million yuan in tuition fees had disappeared without a trace.(Xinhua Online, January 14)Chongqing Lixin Finance Academy never registered with the civil administration department. The school had no legality.Although the Lixin Academy had not received the approval by the civil administration department, it did have a permit to set up a school issued by the Chongqing municipal education committee. As stipulated in the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Promotion of Privately-run Schools," private schools and private education organizations must be licensed by the education department. Their enrollment guidelines and advertisements must also be submitted to the licensing organization to be put on record.A Chongqing municipal education committee division leader says about this that the standards for licensing private education organizations were not exacting, and that school administrators only had to put in an application, prove their financial capabilities and have a teaching site of a certain size, and they can receive a license.After getting its "birth permit," the actual operational situation of Lixin Academy was "unmonitored on both sides." The Chongqing municipal education committee division leader says that day-to-day affairs such as teaching and student recruitment should have been monitored by the education committee of Shapingbei District in Chongqing, where Lixin Academy was located.Zhu Yu, head of adult and vocational education on the Shapingbei District education committee, told reporters that as private schools offering diplomas above those of intermediate vocational training were administered by the provincial education supervisory department, Lixin Academy did not fall under the jurisdiction of the district education committee.The "unclear management" of Lixin Academy by education committees at both municipal and district level gave an opportunity to Yang Hua.Early in the student recruitment period every year, the Chongqing municipal education committee sends out a notice, requiring every school to maintain strict discipline in recruiting students and to send their enrollment guidelines and other materials to the education committee for approval.The school never complied. Chongqing municipal education committee didn't pursue the school's responsibilities, nor has it intervened in the school's unauthorized recruitment of students.Alas! How could the main education supervisory department, charged with very important responsibilities, fail to carry them out in this way, causing consequences of such seriousness? Now that things have come this far, you want to clear yourself of your responsibilities. Can the general public let you?With no supervision and no need for approval, Yang Hua's plan to grab money using a private education organization "front" was able to proceed smoothly.Before the case came to light, he was in the process of getting ready another "private higher education establishment."It really is divine intervention that Yang Hua's actions were brought to light and that he has gone to jail. Otherwise, who knows how many more people would be cheated?Might I ask, how many more cases like this are there in the country?I'm afraid nobody is able to give a clear answer, right?I hereby request the main education supervisory departments in all areas to quickly launch investigations so as to avoid similar tragedies occurring.Okay?
