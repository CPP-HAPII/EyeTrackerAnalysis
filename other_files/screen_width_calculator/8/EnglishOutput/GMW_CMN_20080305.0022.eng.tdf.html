Several countries pledged to vigorously develop renewable energy at the conference.New Zealand pledged to prioritize the development of renewable energy and limit new production projects for fossil fuels in the next ten years, with the goal of using renewable energy to meet 90% of the country's power demand by 2025.Australia said that it would increase the percentage of renewable energy to 20% of its national power supply by 2020.Holland announced that it would increase the proportion of renewable energy to 20% of its energy consumption by 2020 and would raise the efficiency of energy usage by 2% each year.Denmark promised that the percentage of renewable energy would reach at least 30% of its energy consumption by 2025 and that the efficiency of energy usage would be increased by 1.4% each year from 2010 to 2025 and that the funding for the research and development of new energy technology would be doubled by 2010.Italy indicated that it would push the market-based "Green Certificate" mechanism to promote the development of renewable energy and that it would give 55% tax break incentives to the solar heating industry in the next three years and those areas utilizing geothermal and biological energy for heating would get relevant tax credits, and that it would set up incentive funds to reward those buildings with a high efficiency rate of energy usage.Japan said that according to its plans the percentage of renewable energy would account for around 3% of the nation's energy consumption by 2010 and that it would increase the consumption of renewable energy to 16 billion kilowatt hours by 2014.Kenya said that it would stimulate the planting of sorghum crops and use them to produce biological fuel, an action that would decrease Kenya's oil usage by about two million liters in the next three years.Tanzania promised that it would increase the country's population that can use renewable energy for electrical power to at least one million.
