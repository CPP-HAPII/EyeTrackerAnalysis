Zheng Shuyan (Source: PLA Daily Page 3 Issue time: 2007-01-14 06:41)The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle has a famous saying in "Metaphysics": "Philosophy originated from surprises toward the outside world." Actually, the book and scholar's origins were also the same.Think back about humanity in primitive ages: somebody had felt surprised about something which occurred between heaven and earth, and therefore recorded them using some kind of symbols.Afterward, some busybody saw it, made some inquiries at first, understood the matter recorded by the symbols, and then spread them. Then again he bumped into someone with a similar interest; he then linked what had been hearsay with those symbols which were either engraved or painted in the caves, making a connection... Thus, the earliest book and scholar were born, probably in such a process.Human labor was a happy and self-enriching cumulative process; the book and scholar's coming into existence was also such a cumulative process.Without a doubt, books recording human cultures were originated in humanity's imposing historical advancement, yet the two characters denoting "scholar" had always been mixed with some distance and loneliness, as described by the saying "warm-hearted yet aloof, what's the use of a scholar." In the past, Liu Yong might be considered as a famous scholar; it was said that as long as there was a well, you could hear some people there reciting his poems.Yet when he wanted to pursue a career in officialdom, Emperor Song Renzong just brushed him aside with the imperial brush: "This person is good for sipping wines while singing poems,' what's the use of a superficial fame for him?Go composing verses." He was also not inclined to decline the honor, straightforwardly imposing upon himself the task of "composing verses under imperial orders.""I searched and found my old poems; when I pondered over them I was startled by the passing of years." Fortunately once books made their appearance, they became a kind of lifestyle for humanity.The indifference of the contemporary world, the passing of years, they are only light traces in a book.The official titles and ranks really cannot stand up to brilliant literary works. If you don't believe it, then look. It is exactly those verses which were composed by some Song Dynasty scholars including Liu Yong that have become worthy treasures which we Chinese people are forever proud of.Even the English historian Toynbee, after reading the verses, yearned for that: "If I had the choice, I would have been willing to live in China's Song Dynasty."With much reading in the classic books, it is inevitable that the reader will be affected, immersed, and influenced by the manners, the moral characters, the taste, and the emotions of the book. This is often referred to as the scholarly spirit.Though perceptually this is no doubt lofty, yet the world of books is after all too pure; how can it compare to the glamour of worldly affairs?That kind of aesthetic sentiment such as "wielding brushes under the cast shadows of a banana tree, reading books at night accompanied by the fragrance of a beauty" is only a fictional pleasure. In real life when confronted with poverty and snobbish indifference, many people can only sigh: "If I had known earlier that this would not be liked by contemporaries, I would sell more rouges and paint peonies." Fortunately, regardless of reality, there have always been such scholars, who cherish the spiritual values gained from the books more than anything else - they may, perchance, sigh disappointedly, yet in their eyes they still disdain those colorful vulgarities and sycophancy. Perhaps they are often stranded in the livelihood, yet inside their bones they are still convinced that dignity and conscience cannot be priced to sell to officialdom and silver coins.Therefore, they still behaved like the poet and painter Fu Shan, who lived between the end of the Ming dynasty and the beginning of the Qing dynasty: "Don't care about anything, as long as not a slave.As a slave, whatever ingenuity or skill he has, he is still a kind of dog or mouse.""My heart is a balance; it cannot be manipulated by others." These are the words of Zhu Geliang. The master planner and strategist of his generation had always rejected fickleness in characters.He thought that people should have their own spiritual criterion and moral standards, and it should not be manipulated at will by other people.This kind of moral character always shines; the more hardship in life, the more resplendent.Lu Xun appraised a scholar in "Quejie Pavilion Essays" like this: His weapon house, "outside was set up a flag; on it was the writing in bold characters: INSIDE ARE WEAPONS, INCOMERS BEWARE.But the gate was open, inside were some guns, several knives, very clear at a glance, and there's no need to guard." Contemporary writer Sun Li's celebrated works such as "Lotus Pond" and so on have influenced several generations, but what's more worthy of respect is that, for several decades, he wrote articles with sparkling styles, which, regardless of their appropriateness to the occasion at that time, all of them are applicable to the present situation still.Cambridge University in England still keeps the house in which Newton lived while studying there. Pushing open a window you can see an apple tree, and it is said that it's a descendant of that famous apple hitting Newton's head.What is surprising is that this place has not been rebuilt into a scenic tourist spot. It is now still a student dormitory, and the only difference is that only most outstanding students can move in there.Imagine that hundred-year-old house. It definitely can't be said to be comfortable, yet all students would feel the pride of being able to move in.Yes, appreciating the grand masters' styles, feeling the inked fragrances that have come down through the ages, putting the spiritual pursuit above material gains: this is the so-called scholarly spirit.
