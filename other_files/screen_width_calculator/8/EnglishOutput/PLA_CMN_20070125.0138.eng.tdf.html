(Source: Time of Release: 2007-01-25 17:35)Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, January 25 (International Review) Will US-Iran Nuclear Dispute Lead to Military Conflict?Xinhua News Agency Correspondents Liang Youchang and Xu YanyanRecently, the US took many actions targeted at Iran: it detained staff members of Iran's consulate in Iraq; Secretary of State Rice and Secretary of Defense Gates visited the Middle East one after another to persuade their allies in taking a hardline stance against Iran; and it deployed the second aircraft carrier battle group and transported more Patriot anti-missile systems to the Gulf region.In response to this, Iran showed no signs of backing down. It started holding military missile exercises on the 21st, and on the 22nd it made an announcement to forbid 38 IAEA nuclear inspectors from entering the country.Iranian President Ahmadinejad said that Iran is prepared to handle "any threats."Whether the further escalation of the US-Iran nuclear dispute will lead to military conflict has become the focus of international attention.(Sub-headline) "Tit" for "Tat"On the 23rd of last month, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1737 and decided to impose a series of sanctions on Iran. In addition, it requested Iran to suspend all uranium enrichment-related activities within 60 days.Currently, despite the renewed calls and pressure from the US, Iran still firmly refuses to execute the resolution, claiming that it wants to accelerate the implementation of its nuclear plan.Ahmadinejad emphasized the other day, "Even ten similar resolutions cannot affect our economic and nuclear policies."The US has been accusing Iran of secretly developing nuclear weapons under the cover of peaceful use of nuclear energy. In addition it is highly wary of Iran's rising influence in the Gulf and even all the way to the Middle East region. As such, it is pursuing a complete containment policy against Iran: politically, it refuses to hold direct talks with Iran regarding the nuclear issue and the Iraq issue; diplomatically, it makes every effort to urge the Security Council to pass resolutions that have stronger sanctions; economically, it calls on foreign governments and financial institutions to cease economic contact with Iran; and on the military level, it keeps flaunting its military power in the region.US Under Secretary of State Burns said explicitly on the 23rd that the US deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups to the Gulf region precisely because it does not want the Gulf and the Middle East to become regions under Iran's control.Meanwhile, Ahmadinejad said that Iran is prepared to handle "all situations that may arise," and that Iran is not intimidated by sanctions and threats.He also said that Iran will continue to push forward its nuclear plan.On the 24th, Iranian Defense Minister Najjar said that the Iranian army is at its highest level of combat readiness and is prepared at all times to counterattack "any invasions."An analyst here believes that Iran's insistence on developing its nuclear plan is not only for the sake of developing new energy to replace oil, but also because it has associated the development of the nuclear plan with national honor and the symbol of a regional power.Maintaining a tough stance on the nuclear issue can not only enable Iran to elevate its national status but also help it to increase its bargaining chips.(Sub-headline) Iranian President Faces Pressure at Home and AbroadAlthough the Iranian leaders basically share the same view on increasing the country's influence through developing the nuclear plan, they do have certain differences on how to carry out the policies.Especially in the recent period, with the victory of the moderate-conservative party and the reformist party in the Assembly of Experts and local government elections, together with the Security Council's approval of Resolution no. 1737 that imposes sanctions on Iran, Ahmadinejad's hardline policy on the nuclear issue constantly faces doubts from all circles of society.Even the conservative newspaper Islamic Republic also issued an editorial recently to criticize Ahmadinejad. It believes that his lack of flexibility when handling the nuclear issue has led the issue to be referred to the UN Security Council, which not only caused Iran almost to lose its room for diplomatic activities, but also subjected it to international sanctions.Meanwhile, Ahmadinejad's economic policy also came under the harsh criticism of domestic opinions.Critics think that after he took office, the problems of high inflation rates and high unemployment rates have not improved but rather became worse.Although these economic problems are mainly internal issues, they are still related to the nuclear issue to a certain extent.If the Security Council imposes further sanctions, it will have an extremely negative impact on the economy of Iran.The international pressure faced by Ahmadinejad is also getting stronger.As the UN Security Council resolution has already requested Iran to suspend uranium enrichment activities, if Iran continues to take a tough stance on this issue, the conflict between Iran and the US is very likely to turn into a conflict between Iran and the West.Recently the EU said that if Iran refuses to implement the Security Council resolution, the EU will impose stricter sanctions based on the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.(Sub-headline) Not on the Verge of WarAnalysts think that the US and Iran are currently engaged in a round of psychological warfare, both testing the nerves and bottom line of the other party.Considering the internal and external situations, as well as its own actual strength, Iran will try its best to keep the conflict within the scope of a "cold war," in order to prevent military confrontation with the US.Several US-initiated wars in recent years have made Iran realize that the US has sufficient military capability to launch deadly attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities and even its important political and military targets. As a result, Iran must be careful with every step it takes so as to gain maximum national benefits within limited room.Analysts said that Iran's current tough stance is still controllable and far from arriving at a dangerously explosive stage or on the verge of a war, and that the two sides still have room for negotiation in areas such as politics, economy, and foreign affairs.However, there is a risk that the conflict between the US and Iran will continue to escalate.How will the Iran nuclear dispute be resolved? Will Iran and the US end up in military conflict? These questions will continue to make the world nervous.(End)
