The Chinese men's basketball draw was not very ideal. It was placed together with the world champion Spanish team and the U.S.'s "Dream Team" in Group B.This is the first time the Chinese men's basketball team has faced the media after official intensive training.The head coach of the Chinese men's basketball team, Jonas, spoke to the media with ease.Speaking about the draw issue, he humorously said: "The draw is just the draw, if I had the old folk, God's phone number, I would certainly call him so we could do a re-draw.But I don't, so we can only do what we should do."Besides Spain, the U.S. and China, Group B also includes Angola and another 2 spots that will be decided after the mid-July qualification matches.Group A includes Argentina, Lithuania, Iran, Australia, Russia and one team to be decided later.A guard on the Chinese team, Liu Wei said: "The Chinese team made it into the world's top eight twice (Olympics and World Championships). Each draw was very poor, but at this time the Chinese team was able to unleash a very high level of play.Now there isn't anything to be said, just strive for good results with all our strength."Jonas said: "The team's recent training conditions have been very good and their progress has rather great. Currently, the biggest problem is injuries.Yi Jianlian is expected to return to the team in May, Yao Ming maybe in June, but Wang Zhizhi's injury is still unclear. This is what worries me the most."He revealed that since Wang Zhizhi has a knee injury, he hasn't met the rest of the team.The Olympics is coming up quickly. Only some protective treatment can be done for his injury. He's currently training on his own.In the picture Jonas is being interviewed.
