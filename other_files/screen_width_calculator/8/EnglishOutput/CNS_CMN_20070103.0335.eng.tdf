January 3, 2007 11:21The draft bill of the enterprise income tax law incorporating income taxes of domestic and foreign enterprises has recently been submitted to the National People's Congress for initial review.What will this innovation of system, considered one of the signs that China's economic system is becoming mature and standardized, bring to domestic and foreign enterprises in China?Concerning this, reporters had an interview with the leaders, experts and scholars of relevant departments.China's current enterprise income tax laws are established separately for domestic and foreign-fund enterprises.Since the reform and opening-up, China has adopted preferential income tax policies for foreign enterprises which are different from those for domestic enterprises, and these policies have played an important role in reform and opening-up, attraction of foreign capital, and promotion of economic development.As of the end of August 2006, there are 579,000 approved foreign enterprises accumulatively throughout the country, and the actually utilized foreign capital is 659.6 billion US dollars.In 2005 sales revenues of foreign enterprises reached 7,702.4 billion yuan with 639.1 billion yuan paid in various taxes.With the development of the socialist market economy in China, particularly following the transition period of China's accession to the WTO, continued implementation of different tax policies for domestic and foreign enterprises will surely affect the establishment of unified and standardized market environment with fair competition.Minister of Finance Jin Renqing said that there is a great difference between the current tax laws for domestic enterprises and for foreign enterprises, and that enterprises are strongly calling for unifying taxation treatment and fair competition.There are quite large loopholes in the current preferential policies on enterprise income taxes. They distort enterprise behaviors and lead to loss of national tax revenues.Over more than 10 years since the implementation of the current tax laws for domestic and foreign enterprises, great changes have taken place in China's economic and social conditions. It is necessary to make timely amendments according to the new situation.Relevant experts pointed out that the draft bill requesting unification of enterprise income taxes, reduction of statutory tax rates, and adjustment of preferential policies is favorable for creating a tax environment with fair competition for enterprises, encouraging enterprises to improve their capacity of independent innovation, and promoting the optimization and upgrade of China's industrial structure.Under the condition that the domestic capital is relatively adequate and foreign trade grows steadily, it is also possible to positively guide the direction of foreign investment and enhance the quality and level of foreign capital utilization in China.The income tax is currently levied on domestic and foreign enterprises at the same rate of 33%.In the meantime, foreign enterprises in some special regions are levied at a preferential tax rate of 24% or 15%, and domestic low-profit enterprises are levied at two separate brackets of special tax rates of 27% and 18%.The draft bill sets a new tax rate of 25%, 8 percentage points lower than the current statutory tax rate.A preferential rate of 20% is applied to eligible small low-profit enterprises."The tax rate of 25% provided in the draft bill is internationally moderate and low," commented financial and tax experts.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data show that the average corporate income tax rate of 159 countries and regions throughout the world is calculated at 28.64%, and the tax rate of 25% ranks around the 110th.Some experts pointed out after calculation that since the statutory tax rate is reduced, the preferential tax policies are unified and improved, and the pre-tax deduction standard is unified and expanded; the actual tax burden of enterprises will be reduced overall.The enterprise income tax is the second major type of tax following VAT in China.In 2005 enterprise income tax revenues throughout the country reached 551.07 billion yuan, accounting for 17.85% of the national tax revenues of that year.Some experts estimate that due to the reduction of the statutory tax rate, China's annual enterprise income tax revenues may decrease.Authorities from the relevant departments of the Ministry of Finance said that with China's economy in a stage of rapid growth, fiscal revenues maintain quite a good momentum of growth, while enterprise income tax revenues also continue to increase.The state finance is capable of sustaining any decrease in enterprise income tax revenues due to tax rate reduction.[1]
