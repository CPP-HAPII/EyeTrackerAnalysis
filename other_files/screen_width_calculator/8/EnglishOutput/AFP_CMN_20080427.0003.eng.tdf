GRANGEMOUTH, Scotland, 27th (AFP)Workers at Grangemouth Refinery, one of Britain's biggest oil refineries, began a two-day strike today, forcing the closure of a major North Sea pipeline and triggering panic-buying of petrol by consumers.A British Petroleum operator said more than 1200 workers at the Grangemouth Refinery west of Edinburgh began the walkout at 6:00 a.m., while the neighbouring Forties pipeline was shut down at about the same time.The pipeline brings more than 700,000 barrels of crude oil ashore every day and supplies around 40 percent of Britain's oil and gas, plus international markets.The pipeline cannot function without electricity and steam from Grangemouth.The union-led walkout arose from a row over pensions. Refinery staff and families held a demonstration today outside the refinery.Once the strike is over, it may take weeks to resume normal operations.Britain's main opposition party, the Conservative Party, has warned the strike will hit world oil prices.The ruling Labour Party urged all sectors of society to remain calm and said Britain had enough stocks to last through the strike.Despite several assurance by government officials that if everybody keeps calm there will be enough supply, many people are still rushing to the gas stations to stock up on gas, particularly in Scotland and the north of England.
