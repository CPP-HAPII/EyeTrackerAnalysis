January 12, 2007 10:18Chinanews, January 12 According to a report in Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po, Hong Kong Baptist University released a statement on the 11th, expressing its shock and anger at the infringement behavior by a mainland website called "SA Education Net," which had claimed to be run by Baptist University and had hyperlinked in the website to Baptist University's homepage without getting approval from Baptist University. In addition it will reserve the right to all legal actions.A spokesperson for Hong Kong Baptist University stressed that the website had absolutely no connection at all with Baptist University, and that Baptist University had already made a report to the Hong Kong police and had made a complaint to the relevant Internet service provider.The website officially began operation on January 6 this year. On the homepage of the website the insignia of Baptist University can be seen alongside the website's logo. On the "About Us" webpage, the website even directly copies Baptist University President Ng Ching-fai's original "Message from the President" from the official Baptist University website.And on its "SA Education Net Q&A" webpage, you can see in many places wording that says the website has received "assistance" from Baptist University.For example, the website is "a major distance learning Internet platform released during HKBU's 50th anniversary celebrations;" "HKBU will provide part of the funding to support promotion efforts;" etc.Since the website charges registered members 360 renminbi per year in "tuition" membership fees, it is possible that someone is illegally using the name of Baptist University to "sell horsemeat as beefsteak."Baptist University's spokesperson urged netizens, particularly mainland students and parents to carefully check the authenticity of the contents of webpages when they are surfing the Internet.He also added that school authorities would only put information about the university on the university website (www.hkbu.edu.hk).There have been quite a few incidents of the illegal use of the names of Hong Kong universities by mainland websites in recent years.In August last year, City University of Hong Kong found a "Hong Kong College of Business Administration" that called itself a Hong Kong vocational college was accepting students on the Internet pretending it was City University. Four Masters of Business Administration (MBA) courses aimed at mainland students in its "China Center" specifically listed tuition costs in renminbi, raising suspicions that this school was using City University's name to cheat mainland students.
