By Zhang Jinkang January 30, 2007I have never believed that a black-hearted coal mine owner will be afraid of supervision by public opinion.To be fair, the media has - due to supervision by public opinion - often revealed the banning of illegal coal mines and the bringing to justice of black-hearted mine owners. But as compared to the phenomenon of daily illicit and excessive reporting and the frequent occurrences of accidents involving safety production, the serious handling of cases exposed by the media is perhaps lower than one out of 10 thousand.Supervision by public opinion certainly posed a threat to illegal coal mine owners. However, such threat is seldom due to the influence and credibility of the media, but is mostly attributed to the complicated situations in the aftermath of the supervision.Recently, the case of a coal mine owner from Datong beating Lan Chengzhang to death has been a focus of people's attention. Although some of the media involved bore the word "China," but pardon my disrespect, I have been in the media industry for over twenty years, but this is the first time I have heard of some of them.Please try to imagine, how many people can obtain reports filed by such media?Even if some were to obtain those reports, how much influence and deterrence will such reports have?However, illegal coal mine owners are still afraid; but they are not afraid of the media issuing critical reports, rather they are afraid of the numerous greedy hands stretching out to them after the "supervision by public opinion."Of course, it cannot be ruled out that some administrative authorities had indeed rectified illegal coal mines, and even closed them down after obtaining information about them through the media. But the unavoidable reality is that some administrative authorities had - on the pretext of supervision by public opinion - undertaken the "kidnapping" of coal mine owners. And these "kidnappings" can only be "settled" with tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars.In reality, most of the "supervision by public opinion" contained only "supervision" but not "public opinion," and supervision is only up to a certain degree. Journalists and coal mine owners have a "mutual tacit understanding," where the former will load themselves with money and then depart.Under such circumstances, it is impossible for journalists to write truly critical reports. And even if these reports are written, they may not be published, as doing so is no different from blocking one's own "financial path."Coal mine owners are fully aware that the reports will not be published, yet they also do not dare to offend the journalists. Otherwise, if the journalists submit such reports to the relevant administrative authorities for "verification," the amount of money that coal mine owners need to pay out would be massive.Under normal situations, some of the journalists are actually local people extremely familiar with the local situation and with a good network.What's more, they work hand in glove with some personnel within the administrative authorities.Some of these personnel in the administrative authorities have already gained a lot of "benefits" during the issuing and exchanging of coal mining certificates, as well as other aspects of routine production management. So if they want to accumulate more money, they will have to find new excuses. Hence the "supervision by public opinion" from journalists becomes a most adequate and powerful excuse for them - "If the reports of journalists are released, we also cannot bear the outcome, so your coal mine must do this or that, otherwise ..."Hence, spending a little money to purchase some safety and protection is the best choice for these wealthy coal mine bosses.That is the fundamental reason why real journalists and fake journalists repeatedly obtain their goals when they tried to extort money from coal mines.In reality, many coal mines undertake illicit and indiscriminate mining and are riddled with safety problems, and yet despite repeated attempts it is impossible to ban these illegal coal mines. The fundamental reason is that if the irregularities of all administrative authorities were all rectified, who should they turn to when they need to eat and drink?
