The orders were signed by Chairman Hu of the Military Commission, Commander Jing of the Second Artillery Group and political commissar Peng.These are the first reserve professional technical officers to enter the guided missile squadron.This was the first high level reserve officer rank granting ceremony of this size in the Second Artillery Group, and is also not common among the entire army.This not only perfects the Second Artillery Group's warfare equipment security system, but will also inevitably push forward the development, innovation and construction of the backup force of the Second Artillery Group.Through the hard work of the force since the formation of the Second Artillery Group's reserve unit over two years ago, the unit's organizational structure has been soundly implemented, barracks and facilities have basically been completed, the personnel has been assigned scientifically and reasonably, the operating mechanism has gradually been polished, strategic training has become more and more standardized, and initial battle security ability has been formed. The unit's overall construction has stepped into a brand new development phase.Over 98% of the Second Artillery Group's officers are professional technical officers. The first high-level reserve professional technical officers that are being incorporated into Beijing's reserve group this time mainly come from equipment manufacturers from across the country. They are all professionals from technical positions. They are professional technology's "leading geese."From now on, through the all-in-one training of active duty troops, they will achieve complementary strengths, solve those technical security force issues that are hard to solve, expensive to build, and urgently needed for warfare. They will unleash a usefulness for wartime equipment maintenance that cannot be replaced, and provide strong personnel and technical supports for the Second Artillery Group's professional equipment security maintenance ability to realize a new leap.
