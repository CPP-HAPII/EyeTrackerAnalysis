Xiong Xiaozheng 2007-01-10Coubertin: "I only care about social reform, or I think that in order to lay a foundation for the coming century, this society can only have shared values and strength if we establish new educational methods for the new era." - CoubertinAt the end of the 19th century, Coubertin, who was dedicated to social reform, tried to establish new educational methods for the arrival of the new century, in order to establish "shared values and strength for humanity" and to promote world peace.Among the many traditional sporting cultural patterns, he thought the "Olympics," which served as a system for social regulation in ancient Greece, came closest to his ideals.Coubertin told his supporters: "What I am reviving of the Olympics is not its ancient format. Rather it is the discovery of the central role of education for our country and for humanity. In this age of technological revolution and the international spread of democracy, I am doing my utmost to bring it back because I have found that for modern man it is the support for his intelligence, the support for his morality, and, to a certain extent, the support for his religion." Starting from this goal, Coubertin thought that the modern Olympics should have three basic characteristics:"religious sport" with "Olympism" as its basic faith,an educational goal with the mission of illustrating the philosophy of the active life,and maintaining the principle of participation with a goal of making morality paramount.Coubertin said that the fundamental difference between the Olympics and the world championships was that it not only pursues the technical value of competition, but more importantly, it pursues the moral value of competition."Only when the level of the participant's 'athlete's character' shows improvement in the field of moral values can (the Olympics) achieve full success."The mission of the modern Olympic Games is to widely promote the basic tenets of Olympism: that is, the "faster, higher, stronger" spirit of transcendence, the spirit of competition "giving priority to participation," the cooperative spirit of fair competition, the international spirit of peace, friendship, and progress, and the democratic spirit of equality and openness, etc. "Transplant them from the regional environment to the whole environment; transfer them from special kinds of activities into all of an individual's activities."Through the Olympic Games, propound to people the life philosophies such as being happy to make an effort, the practice of respecting society's public morality and the rule-abiding competition, as well as make contributions to the promotion of the personal harmonious development of humanity and the establishment of society that safeguards human dignity and peace.Obviously, the educational function is the core value that Coubertin established for the modern Olympic Games.His main aims in reviving the Olympic Games were to promote a person's all-round development and promote harmony and fairness in human society through Olympic sporting education, thereby establishing a peaceful and more beautiful world.It is these ideals that made the Olympic Games a socio-cultural phenomenon with global impact that transcends racial differences, national differences, and religious differences.The men's 100-meter final in the first Olympics was ready to start.(Provided by Civilization Magazine Press) However, in the more than 100 years of history of the modern Olympic Games, the target values that Coubertin chose have often faced challenges in the survival and development of the Olympic Games.Particularly since the 1980s, with the continuing expansion of the groups of participants in the Olympic Games, the competition among different participating groups seeking to maximize their own profits has produced clashes among the value orientations of various interest groups. Also, the ever-growing control of multinational corporations and the mass media, and the over-ambitious hopes for Olympics to promote economic development of every city that holds them (or city that bids for holding them) are leading the Olympic Games gradually away from its initial value choices. A trend of alienation has appeared in their development.Mr. Samaranch said at the 109th General Assembly of the International Olympic Committee: "We must carry out the necessary reforms to consolidate the Olympic Games, and at the same time we must not give up our beliefs; we must carry out reforms to make the Olympic ideals more prominent; we must carry out reforms that do not conflict with the wishes of Coubertin..." Rogge, current president of the International Olympic Committee, also made the following declaration in his inauguration speech: "The motto of the Olympics is faster, higher, and stronger.Of course we will continue to keep this motto, but with the new century coming, perhaps it is necessary for sport to have a new motto, that is: cleaner, more human, and more united."The wish for reform expressed by the two presidents fully embodies the International Olympic Committee's engagement with the problems faced by the contemporary Olympic Games.The problems encountered by the contemporary Olympic Games generally reflect: conflict between the Olympic ideals and its survival and development; conflicts in clashes among different interests of participating groups; conflict between limited resources and unlimited transcendence. In the final analysis it is the problems of choice of value orientations of the Olympic Games, the choice of development models and the choice of interest groups, and at its core is again the problem of "the crisis of humanity."The 2008 Beijing Olympics will fly high the flag of the "human Olympics." It is a call to return the Olympics to its humanist traditions. The "Olympic education" currently underway in Beijing is a promotion of the core values of the Olympic Games. This will all be of help in controlling the trend of alienation in the Olympic Games and will provide a valuable revelation for the reform of the Olympics."One world, one dream;" the Beijing Olympics is sure to demonstrate the core values of the Olympic Games, promote the sublimation of people's ideology, and make a positive contribution to peace, harmony and accord for humanity and to promoting Olympism, bringing comfort to the founder of the modern Olympics.(The writer is a professor at Beijing Sports University)
