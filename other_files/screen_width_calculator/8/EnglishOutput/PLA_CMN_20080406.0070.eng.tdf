We request emergency assistance from your battalion."At 10:00 on the night of April 4th, after receiving the local government's telephone call for help, this battalion rapidly started an emergency action plan. They urgently dispatched over 180 officers and soldiers over 50-kilometers away to the site of incident to put out the mountain fire.When the battalion got to the scene of the fire, the fire was continuously spreading. It was only over 20 meters away from the closest area of the village. The situation was desperate.Under the orders of the battalion commander, Yan Xin, the officers and soldiers rapidly shoveled an isolation strip to ensure the safety of the village's citizens.Soon after, the officers and soldiers coped with the danger of the dark night's roads, high hills, thick forest and other difficulties. In spite of fatigue, they fought courageously into the night, gradually controlling the fire.At 4 in the morning today, the sky gradually brightened.The officers and soldiers in the battle developed a tenacious fighting style, pushing forward towards the fire in the shape of a net to stamp out the fire and check every inch of ground for embers that could start a fire, so as not to miss any hidden dangers.At 7:00, the fire on the mountain was finally completely extinguished.According to reports, this battalion has rushed to provide emergency aid for the place where it stationed many times. They have received praise from the masses in the place where it stationed.In June of 2006, the place where this battalion stationed experienced the biggest flood that could happen once in 50 years and their officers and soldiers saved over 460 people. In March of last year, in a blizzard rarely seen in more than 50 years, the officers and soldiers removed snow to relieve disaster and helped the people rebuild their homes.
