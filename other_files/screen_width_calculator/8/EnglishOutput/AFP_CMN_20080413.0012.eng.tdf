London (AFP), 12th.Today, China's ambassador to Britain, Fu Ying said, protests towards the Olympic torch relay show that China and the West are lacking understanding more and more.Fu Ying wrote a letter to Britain's "Sunday Telegraph," attacking the "violent" British protestors that attempted to snatch the torch in this month's relay in London and accusing Western media of demonizing China.She wrote: "Standing between East and West, I am concerned that mutual impressions between the people of China and the West are quickly drifting in opposite directions.""I cannot help but ask why, when talking about China, people don't question the exact meaning of those vague accusations but rather just easily accept them; Why a story with no facts or figures to support it is able to occupy front page news for days."Fu Ying said that those who obstructed the torch relay to protest China's suppression of Tibet have all been mislead.She wrote: "Of those loud protesters, many of them have probably not been to Tibet."To Chinese people, Tibet is a loved land and they are able to accept much information about Tibet. Four million tourists visit Tibet every year."She said: "(In Tibet) there may be complex problems with religion and politics, but the people there are all well-fed, well-clothed and well-housed."She said protesting the torch has already made young Chinese people "start to reconsider their overall views about the West."Fu Ying said: "Many people who nourished romantic notions of the West in the past now feel extremely disappointed by the media's attempt to demonize China."She said that each countries' media should try harder to understand China, and called out Western reporters in China to show more "respect."
