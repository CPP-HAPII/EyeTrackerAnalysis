It reached 207.36 billion US dollars, an increase of 13% over the same period last year.Japan has become China's third largest trade partner.As of the end of November 2006, Japan has realized a total of 57.45 billion US dollars of investment in China, becoming the second largest source of China's foreign capital.From January to October in 2006 Chinese companies had invested a contractual amount of 12.1895 million US dollars in Japan with an accumulative total investment of 180 million US dollars.Further deepening economic and trade cooperation has provided positive conditions for the development of the political relations between the two countries.In 2006 Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe paid a visit to China as soon as he took office. The leaders of the two countries reached consensus on overcoming the obstacles in developing bilateral relations, and the Sino-Japanese relations made important progress toward the track of normal development.Since then President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Abe again reached consensuses on forming bilateral strategic and mutually beneficial relations, promoting exchanges and cooperation in various fields, and other issues at the APEC summit held in Hanoi, Vietnam. This has created more positive conditions and broader space for further development of Sino-Japanese economic and trade cooperative relations.The year 2007 happens to mark the 35th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.Experts here think that the two sides from now on should strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in areas such as energy conservation, environmental protection, small and medium-sized enterprises, and service outsourcing so as to promote the comprehensive development of Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations in all aspects, at multiple levels, and in a broad range of fields.(End)
