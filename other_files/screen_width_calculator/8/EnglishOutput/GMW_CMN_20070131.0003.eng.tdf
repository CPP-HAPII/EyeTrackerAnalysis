Deng Haijian (teacher of Jiangsu), January 31, 2007Secretary of Shenzhen Municipal Party Committee Li Hongzhong called the Bureau of Communications of Shenzhen Municipality to complain the uncleanness of individual buses and demanded the communications department to take effective measures in finding solutions to the problem.As a result, Shenzhen launched the 'Public Transportation Cleanliness Overhaul' Initiative again.Yesterday, the Municipal Bureau of Communications held an emergency meeting to plan the Public Transportation Cleanliness Overhaul Initiative and requested "to clean every bus".(January 25, Nanfang Daily)We should say that this is a favorable news in urban people's livelihood.Secretary of Municipal Party Committee concerned about public transportation and urged the municipal public transportation department to actually clean the 'snow at its doorstep'.In this sense, we should give the Secretary who showed concern for details of people's livelihood a round of applause.Actually, the appeal to have each bus cleaned cannot be considered a complicated proposition. Many residents who pack into the filthy buses everyday have long harbored resentment and grievances. I imagine there are also many complaints. If that does not work, drivers and conductors naturally have seen or heard many complaints about 'filthy buses' by residents.Why did the voice of cleaning every bus made by the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee alone can awaken the muddle-headed?It is of course, right for the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee to concern about the cleanliness of buses. However, no self-defined administrative power that comes from top down can produce any predictable results.The untold worry of the residents is: In this era of diversified interests and revival of rights, whether the value orientation of public interest or public decision making 'turns left' or 'goes right' always depends on which interest group have more voices. Will urban decisions orient more toward democracy and fairness without full expressions of citizens' words but rely on the self-defined decision-making inertia by the government alone?There are a few antilogies in the issue of 'cleanliness of public transportation' that require our reflection: First, they were both voices of the citizens. Why did many factual complaints of bus passengers worth less than the complaint of a citizen with the status of a Secretary of the Party Committee?Why couldn't the public transportation department that has huge public opinion channel take the initiative to give public opinion a systemic outlet in the matter of listening to citizens' voices?Or you can say, if not for the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee 'poking his nose into other people's business', would they clean the urban buses spontaneously?In addition, public transportation is an industry that involves public good. It is also a monopolized industry. The savageness and arrogance of some urban public transportation has also become an 'epidemic' under the monopoly system. Then, is there any effectively monitored system that follows up to help citizens express and achieve powerful effects?Originally, if we only look at it from the logic of Economics, complaints of many passengers should worth more than the complaint of a Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee.A Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee has more macro decision-making view that requires his attention in the first place. The best answer for "the cleanliness level of a bus' should be sought and responded by residents.More importantly, every city has many more details of people's livelihood that deserve attention. A Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee alone 'is willing yet unable' to take care of all these: For example, the scarcity and lack of trashcans along main roads; for example, the 'non-hindrance' facilities and 'unisex' public restrooms provided for the handicapped; for example, the sharp edges and corners on the handrails of buses; for example, trash suddenly thrown from above, for example, having abundant and precise public signs that are people-oriented... the vast public are the only ones who always live among them.In a sense, citizens' voices and secretary's complaint are probably two polarities of a seesaw: more citizens' voices will lead to less secretary's complaint.'Good administration' of a city is essentially a kind of public administration that requires to give citizens' voices more opportunities and greater power.
