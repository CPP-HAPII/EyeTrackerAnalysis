January 8, 2007 10:21Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 7 (Correspondent Ding Yi) According to a report in the Czech newspaper Pr√°vo on the 6th, a sample survey by the Czech Institute of Health Information and Statistics shows that 22.3% of Czechs have taken drugs, and drug users are becoming younger every day.The survey showed that marijuana is the drug most frequently taken by Czechs, and among young people the proportion of drug users is getting higher and higher.Among young people between the ages of 18 and 24, 40% have taken drugs.Around 50% of Czech students took marijuana before the age of 13.Czech schools have now become among the easiest places to get hold of drugs.The survey also showed that the distribution of drug users is correlated with their educational level.Most drug users have either only studied to primary school or middle school level or are unemployed, while there is little drug abuse among those with university-level education, married people and people with steady employment.Even though the Czech Republic formulated a national five-year anti-drug strategy in 2004, the situation for the fight against drug abuse remains extremely grim.Therefore, experts have called on the government and related bodies to continue stepping up their anti-drug efforts and mobilize the resources of the whole of society to actively take part in this campaign so as to contain the further spread of drug abuse.
