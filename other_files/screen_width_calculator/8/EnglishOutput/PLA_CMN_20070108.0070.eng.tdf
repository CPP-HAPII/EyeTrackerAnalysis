Zhu Xudong, Reporter of Xinhua News Agency (Source: Xinhua News Agency, Dispatch time: January 8, 2007 14:28)Traveling day and night despite wind and snow.Fan Yuening, Deputy Chief Clerk of the Jiangsu Wuxi Development and Reform Commission finished his 45th trips to Yan'an during the New Year period.In this trip, he paid for the rural cooperative medicare for 2,060 poor peasants in Yan'an and subsidized 24 poor students with the thirty thousand yuan donated by all walks of society in Wuxi. His journey covered more than 5,000 miles.Every person interprets the word 'happiness' differently.Fan Yuening's happiness is to help more children in Yan'an to attend school, to act as go-between for villagers in Yan'an to arrange for projects that they need, to build the platform for communications between the eastern and western region, and to accelerate rapid development of the western region as soon as possible.Fan Yuening came to the sacred revolutionary place of Yan'an by chance nine years ago. He saw hardships that he could not see in the advanced eastern region. As a result, he has been all the more devoted to the poverty relief work in Yan'an.As of now, he has brokered nearly 1,000 poor students in Yan'an to pair off with kind-hearted people in Wuxi who provide them with financial aid and acted as go-between in the completion of over 30 poverty relief projects.His newly developed 'project' is to help poor peasants join rural cooperative medicare.It is indeed thought provoking that an ordinary civil servant can assemble such huge social strength to conduct diverse work in helping the poor.Yet, for the rapid development in the western region, apart from partnering relief at the governmental level, society also need more enthusiasts and kind-hearted people like Fan Yuening.A meeting by chance impelled Fan Yuening to start helping poor children in Yan'an.In early Spring of 1998, Fan Yuening accompanied the Wuxi Party and government delegation to travel to Yan'an to explore matters in partnering relief.When the delegation's motorcade passed through Tongerwan Village, Yichuan County, he saw a very dilapidated dark cave that was less than 10 square meters by accident.It was a primary school with less than 20 students. On the wall in front of the door, a faded national flag that was weathered through times was flying aloft in the wind in an indomitable and eye-catching manner.A 23-year-old girl was both the principal and the only teacher.She had to walk 30 miles of mountain paths to go to class everyday. She only earned 50 yuan a month in salary and could not even be paid on time. The village chief could only lead her to take turns in delivering meals to students' homes everyday, twice a day.The delegation pooled together 500 yuan and tucked the money into her hands so she could buy a new national flag and add some textbooks for the children.The female teacher who was thinly clad, the poor and lovely children, the dilapidated cave, and the national flag that flapped in the wind were freeze-framed in Fan Yuening's camera. They also dropped a huge rock in Fan Yuening's heart.He felt that he should do something.He said, "Compared to them, I feel like I am living in heaven!A person's life only lasts for several decades. In this limited life span, I may not be able to help 1,000 children. However, I can help 1 or 10 children. I may not be able to accomplish 1,000 deeds, but I can do 1 or 10 deeds.All we need to do is to smoke one less cigarette and drink one less bottle of wine and we can add some warmth to these poor teacher and students."In the days that follow, Fan Yuening started to travel between Wuxi and Yan'an ceaselessly to act as a go-between for the poor students in Yan'an.In this nine years, Fan Yuening spends each year's Golden Week and the 14 days public holidays entirely on the road from Wuxi to Yan'an for at least five days each time.From 'Multilevel Marketing of Poverty Relief' to 'Direct Sale of Poverty Relief'Wang Li of Xijiao Secondary School in Yichuan County was the first Yan'an child whom Fan Yuening helped. Now, Wang Li has become a manager of a property management company in Wuxi.In order to thank her benefactor, Wang Li changed her name to Wang Li Fan Zhou to incorporate the homophony of the last names 'Fan' and 'Zhou' of Fan Yuening and his wife into her own name.In order to help more Yan'an children, Fan Yuening turns his eye to his relatives and friends, then turns to his relatives' friends and friends' relatives. Fan Yuening calls it multilevel marketing of poverty relief."Many people are willing to participate in charity and poverty relief. However, they do not know whom to donate the money to and whether the money donated will be embezzled in their daily giving.If they know their subsidy targets and can feel their growth, then it will be very real and meaningful." Wuxi Haomaide Supermarket's General Manager Xu Jianfeng reminded him a long time ago.As a result, Fan Yuening started to choose potential helping targets in Yan'an with purpose. His standards are: First, they must be intelligent; second, their academic results must be above-average; and third, their families should be relatively poor.If they meet these requirements, Fan Yuening will register them one by one and take their pictures to bring the information back to Wuxi. After he finishes making the pictures and the lists, he will use his leisure time to carefully implement and make arrangements to avoid the intermediate link of 'not seeing the person' in traditional relief and ensure the quality of exchange and communications in the partnering to help.Fan Yuening calls it direct sale of poverty relief."Even if I sell my house, I cannot help too many people so I have to market my charity work well," said Fan Yuening.Now, Fan Yuening's direct sale of poverty relief is gaining increasing acceptance and approval.In 2005, Fan Yuening facilitated the long-term partnering relief between units in Wuxi including institutions, Party and work committees, and individuals with 248 outstanding students with financial difficulties in Yan'an.In 2006, all circles in Wuxi also successfully helped 200 extremely poor students, orphans in school, and offspring of the old Red Army in Yan'an.Helping Yan'an Cannot Rely on Building Hope Primary Schools AloneOnce enterprises hear that they need to help Yan'an, their first reaction is to help build Hope primary schools.Fan Yuening keeps explaining to them, "The mountain regions in Yan'an lack too many things. Some places lack water. Even though primary schools are built, no children will attend. Some places have extremely poor sanitation. The priority is to support public health services of the locality...We need to help them with what they urgently need."Fan Yuening has an intimate knowledge of this.Chengluo Village of Danzhou Town in Yichuan County, Yan'an is the most highly populated village in the county. The village has 223 peasant households and over 800 people. Their ancestors had been drinking the poor quality water with extremely high fluorine content that ran through the ditch in front of the village. Many people suffered from Kaschin-Beck disease since they were young.In the end of 1999, Fan Yuening wrote a detailed investigation material and brought it back to Wuxi to search for units or individuals willing to fund the forty-thousand-dollar-well-drilling fee.In early 2000, two high-quality springs were drilled in the valley five miles from Chengluo Village with the help of Wuxi Trust and Investment Company.Through the effort of Fan Yuening, Wuxi Trust and Investment Company donated another one hundred sixty thousand in capital to draw the high-quality water source to the caves of the peasants.There has not been any new Kaschin-Beck disease patient since 2001.In 2001, Fan Yuening went down to Xialiyuan Village of Yingwang Township in Yichuan County to conduct investigations and created a list with detailed information on the basic situations of the 106 peasant households such as the 'population situation', 'financial situation', 'expectations and demands' to bring it back to Wuxi.In the end, 106 Party members, model workers, and excellent workers' representatives of the Wuxi Yibai Group formed helping partners with the 106 peasant households in northern Shaanxi thousands of miles away.Through contacts via telephone and correspondence with their 'rich relatives' during these years, the peasants in Xialiyuan Village think in a more active way and have more open information. The spirit and the quality of life of the entire village have improved.Rapid Developments in Western Region Require Enthusiast Like Fan YueningPeople in Yan'an thanked Fan Yuening's magnanimous acts in their unique ways.A woman whose name was unknown stitched a pair of cloth shoes for Fan Yuening based on his footprints. When Fan Yuening visited the peasants' homes, their relatives and friends would pack the bedside to chat until dawn. A stranger at the Hukou Waterfall could give Fan Yuening the only umbrella in a day with heavy downpour...In the end of 2005, Yan'an City awarded Fan Yuening the 'Honorary Resident' title. In September 2006, Shaanxi Province selected the 'Shaanxi Charitable Award' and Yan'an City gave their only quota to Fan Yuening.Now, Fan Yuening is the charity commissioner of Yan'an Charity Association in Wuxi.At present, Fan Yuening is actively raising more cooperative medicare fund for the poor peasants in the mountain region in Yan'an."I want to enable more Yan'an peasants to enjoy the advantages of cooperative medicare. Each person only needs to pay 10 yuan and when they fall sick, they can reimburse hundreds and thousands of yuan," said Fan Yuening confidently. "All we need is to give several hundred or several thousand yuan and we can help peasants of a village or even several villages in Yan'an to join the rural cooperative medicare."Fan Yuening said that every time he encounters difficulties, he will think of the female teacher in the poor and remote mountain village who earns 50 yuan a month but persists in raising the national flag and teaching the children.As long as everyone finds a way, the backward western region will develop faster!
