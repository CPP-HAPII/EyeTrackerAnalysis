April 6, 2008People.com, April 6 - According to news from Caracas, Venezuela rejected the 2007 annual report of the International Human Rights Committee, believing that the content of this document related to the so-called violation of human rights in Venezuela was all false.This is what the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a communiqué.The communiqué by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the International Human Rights Committee made this report by drawing conclusions about many countries but there was no proof in the materials that it used, and that those numbers and opinions came from some opposition-leaning organizations.It cannot rule out that this report from the International Human Rights Committee is another action of the movement to make Venezuela lose its international reputation. This movement is initiated by the American government to oppose the Venezuelan institution.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed Venezuela's action for safeguarding human rights, rights to free speech, legal rights to social protest and respect for the existing lives in Venezuela.The facts are the opposite of the report from this committee. During these years the Bolivar revolution in Venezuela has yielded undeniable progress in respecting, enjoying and safeguarding all of the Venezuelan people's human rights. This is the result of the government's elimination of national poverty, inequality and exclusion, which are the consequences of carrying out the policy of Neoliberalism.The report denied efforts made by Venezuela to fully safeguard constitutional rights.
