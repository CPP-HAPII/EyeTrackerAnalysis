AFP on the 27th, BangkokThai Prime Minister Samak pledged today that Thailand will not cut rice exports. While Samak was making this remark, the continuous rise in prices of rice, a staple food for Asian people, is triggering concerns of food shortage.Samak noted in his weekly national televised address that Thailand has a plentiful supply of rice.Thailand is the largest rice exporter in the world.Samak said: "Thailand will not announce a ban on rice exports. Banning rice exports will destroy Thailand's reputation."Samak explained that Thai farmers are now planting the fifth crop in two years to ensure that they can meet the market demands. Traditionally, Thai farmers plant two crops each year.Samak said: "When we grow rice now, it is not like in the past when it was harvested every three to four months.Nowadays we have rice harvested every day; we will not encounter a problem of rice shortage."At present, international market demand for Thai rice has dramatically increased after Vietnam and India, chief rice exporting countries, banned rice exports to meet their domestic demands.The price survey recently published by the Thai Rice Exporters Association shows that the price of Pathumthani fragrant rice, a main rice export, was at 998 US dollars per tonne for export on the 23rd, up about 35% from a month ago.
