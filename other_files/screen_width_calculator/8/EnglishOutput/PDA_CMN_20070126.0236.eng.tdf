This was yet another successful example of both sides of the Taiwan Strait fighting crimes together. The anti-crime cooperation between both sides of the Strait has been going on for many years and there was "certainly no money entanglement."In fact, criminals fleeing Taiwan have been captured many times in the Mainland, and the Mainland police have never taken even one cent of monetary reward from Taiwan.Issued by China News Service, Photo by Huang ShaohuaChina News Service, Taipei, January 25 - (Reporter Huang Shaohua, Lu Mei) Taiwan "Criminal Investigation Bureau" Commissioner Huang Mao-sui indicated today that the Taiwan bank security van robbery suspects Li Han-yang and Li Chin-tsan fled to the Mainland and were captured successfully and repatriated. This was yet another successful example of both sides of the Taiwan Strait fighting crimes together.Police from both sides of the Taiwan Strait closely cooperating in fighting crimes have extremely pure intentions: "There is certainly no money entanglement."Li Han-yang and Li Chin-tsan were repatriated today and escorted to Taipei.Afterwards, Huang Mao-sui accepted our press interview and expressed "many thanks to the Mainland public security brothers."He said that after this case occurred, Taiwan police immediately notified Mainland police, and cooperative crime fighting mechanisms began. The Mainland police all together sent out more than 40 police officers and coordinated with various provinces and cities to launch the search and arrest.After only a short eight days, the Li Han-yang Brothers were captured.This showed that the Mainland police investigation efficiency is extremely high, the work is very great, and the Taiwan people are deeply impressed.At the same time, the Mainland police arrest and repatriation process is very rigorous and quite worth "being studied together."Before this, some people claimed on Taiwan's TV debate program that the reason that Mainland police was so active in catching the fleeing Taiwan criminals was for Taiwan's monetary reward.Regarding this, Huang Mao-sui repeatedly clarified, "There's definitely not such a problem."The Mainland police have captured Taiwanese criminal offenders many times, and the Taiwan police have not paid out even one cent to the Mainland.He pointed out that both sides of the Taiwan Strait have a mutual understanding that fighting crimes together is advantageous to people on both sides.Therefore, police from both sides of the Taiwan Strait closely cooperating in fighting crimes have extremely pure intentions: "There is certainly no money entanglement."There is no doubt.He indicated that he believes police from both sides of the Taiwan Strait will be able to cooperate and relate more closely together to safeguard people's lives and property on both sides.
