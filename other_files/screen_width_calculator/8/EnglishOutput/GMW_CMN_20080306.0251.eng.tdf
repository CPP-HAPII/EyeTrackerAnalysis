Correspondent Zhou Yingfeng, 2008-03-06Xinhuanet.com, Beijing, March 6Deputy to the National People's Congress and Mayor of Huai'an City in Jiangsu Province Fan Jinlong said, the "three rural issues" and excess liquidity are hot topics at the two conferences. In fact, these two topics can entirely be discussed in connection with each other.He advises the government to introduce target-oriented policy measures to attract surplus funds in the market to the countryside which is in real need of funds.Fan Jinlong said, on one hand there is excess liquidity, and on the other hand the development of rural areas needs large amounts of funds.Speaking in specifics, there are five areas in which the countryside needs funds invested: First, agricultural production conditions,including the water conservancy and irrigation, electric power supply, and other facilities that are needed for agricultural production.Currently, the agricultural facilities in some places have already shown signs of age, etc.Second, infrastructure in rural areas.Perfecting infrastructures such as roads, transportation, potable water, forestation, and so on is the fundamental work for improving production and living conditions in the countryside.Third, high efficiency eco-agriculture.High efficiency eco-agriculture is an important channel for increasing revenue for farmers. The output is high, so are investments; it requires the influx of large amounts of funds from the outside to support the management and development of agricultural industrialization.Fourth, the construction of the new countryside.China has many people but little land. The scattered villages need to be centralized in order to save on land resources.Completing this work also requires financial support.Fifth, farmers starting a business.Whether the farmers start their businesses as growers, cultivators, transporters of agricultural products, or other agricultural services, they all need financial support.Fan Jinlong believes that currently, excess liquidity has no way of flowing to the countryside mainly because investors need to consider their output-input ratios.Fan Jinlong recommends that the nation should introduce some policies of encouragement to motivate state-owned commercial banks to "stoop down," making them truly lay roots in the countryside and serve the needs of the "three rural issues;" to allow non-government credit to "float upward," giving it a legal status for operation; to allow the influx of industrial and commercial capital to the countryside, enabling it to reap reasonable returns from investing in projects related to the "three rural issues."
