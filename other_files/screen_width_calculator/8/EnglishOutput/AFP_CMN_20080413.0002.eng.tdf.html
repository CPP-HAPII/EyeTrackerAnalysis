Hanoi (AFP), 13th.Marine scientists warn that the South China Sea, which is polluted, home to busy sea shipping lanes and caught up in the controversy of claims to sovereignty by many countries, is currently suffering a serious attack on its environment that threatens the future supply of fish crops.The South China Sea is located in the heart of South-East Asia, an area of concentrated pollution and rapid industrialization. The United Nations says, within the past 10 years, the South China Sea has already lost 16 percent of its coral reefs and mangroves as well as 30% of its sea grass.At last week's seminar held in Hanoi, Vietnam, it was pointed out that the South China Sea's explosive fishing activity, regardless of whether it's legal or illegal, family owned fishing boats or large scale deep sea trawlers, has almost exhausted the fishing resources that are relied on by millions of people.Vietnam's representative to the United Nations Environment Programme South China Sea Project pointed out that the key problems are degradation and even complete loss of sea basin habitat, overfishing and too much land-based pollution. There are also many, many problems, but these problems are the most serious.Countries surrounding the South China Sea include China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. In total, these countries have about 350 million citizens along the coastline.Symington, a marine specialist with the World Wildlife Fund said: "regardless of whether it is direct or indirect, there is an enormous population here that is extremely reliant on the South China Sea's fishing industry to make a living. Also, this is the most biologically diverse marine area in the world."Symington, at the fourth Global Conference on Oceans, Coasts and Islands told AFP: "Now, fishing boats must go farther and spend more time in order to get the same amount of fish as before, but the fish that are being caught are smaller and smaller."He added: "There are many instances of illegal or unreported fish catches. Many fishing boats fly flags of convenience. These are both loopholes."
