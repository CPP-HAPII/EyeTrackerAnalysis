There is an increasingly prominent discrepancy between the expansion of the force's training requirements and the inadequacy of the strength of academy training.Starting in 2001, the air force has actively searched for a new way to jointly train army and civilian personnel. They have established a mechanism for entrusting new equipment research and development manufacturers to organize technical personnel training.They give prominence to new equipment inspection & debugging, operational use, fault diagnosis & removal and other knowledge and skill training. They have adopted a way of combining intensified studies of new equipment principals, structure, function and other theoretical studies with on-site extension studies with bringing in technical professionals to teach. This is done in order to raise trainees' ability to safeguard and maintain new equipment.Trainees' general reaction is that this kind of training method is visual, direct and strongly targeted, it can raise the safeguard ability of those that are accustomed to the new equipment structure and principals. It realizes a connection between the beginning and the end.It is reported that the air force will still add 3 intense training bases this year. Professional instructors from the air force's relevant academies will also attend the intensified training together with the force's technical safeguard personnel.
