Liu Dongsheng (Source: PLA Daily, Page 3, Time of Release: 2007-01-20 06:49)Last year, right before the veteran soldiers were due to retire, I went to a detachment to inspect its work. I asked about the counseling work devoted to the retiring soldiers, and the comrade from the detachment's office reported to me that notices concerning this task were sent out half a month ago and that all squadrons were carrying it out well.I then went to inspect the lower ranks, but I discovered that the problems with the thinking of many soldiers had not been effectively dealt with. One squadron even had not received the notice, let alone "proceeding in accordance with the spirit of the notice."You see, the arrangement for this work has made a full circle, but it hasn't "landed" in some of the lower units!If we compare the development of the army to a vehicle, and the party committee to the "driver," then aren't the lower ranks and the administrative offices the "front wheels" and "rear wheels?"The front wheels need the rear wheels to drive them forward, and the turning of the wheels only has any value when the vehicle is moving forward.Suppose the rear wheels are lifted off the ground. Now however fast they turn, the vehicle will not move forward even an inch. What use is this kind of turning?We can see from this that in measuring whether the work of the administrative offices is valuable, the key is not to look at how fast they are "turning" themselves, but to see if the work of the lower ranks has been accelerated and whether the "vehicle" of army development is moving forward.The reason why the work is not being carried out in some work units is mainly because there are many intangible "chocks" holding the administrative offices off solid "ground."First is "superficiality" in the approach to work.Some cadres in the administrative offices are too lazy to think, and their approach to work is superficial. Content to copy and follow orders in the administrative offices, they see how many documents they've sent out, how many meetings they've held, how many task forces they've dispatched and how many examples of experience they have been sent by the higher-level organs as the same as carrying out their work.Even though they've worked up a sweat "driving the vehicle," in reality a lot of their work has not actually "landed" in the lower ranks. The lower ranks have not started "moving." Second is "wrong focus" in the guidance of work.In dealing with their work, some office cadres do not look at whether the lower ranks urgently need it, but look at whether it has benefits for the furtherance of their own reputation.Because their guiding principle is not correct, in their work they are often content with a grand format and eager to pursue a lot of action on the surface. With one idea today, an innovation tomorrow, they seem to be busy all day long, but what they are actually doing are things that the lower ranks don't need, and officers and soldiers don't welcome. Third is "excessiveness" in working methods.Some require too much urgency in dealing with their work, assigning the work today and asking for progress report tomorrow. The lower ranks can't keep up with carrying it out at all. Some set their targets too high. Even if the lower ranks jump right to it, they are not certain to achieve them. Even if they want to carry out the work, they can't. And some arrange too much work, stuffing whatever "thread" they have into the "eye of a needle" of the lower ranks, so the lower ranks find it hard to deal with it all.With all of these different kinds, it's not just the administrative offices that are busy: the lower ranks are busy with them. But in reality their busyness isn't hitting the spot. Naturally, it can scarcely achieve good results.Keeping the "wheels" on the ground is just a metaphor. The real meaning is to adopt an approach that really gets to grips with the work and goes for real results, getting every bit of work fully implemented step by step.I think that on this issue, administrative offices must first set straight their "attitude" toward implementation, put themselves on the same "horizon" as the lower ranks. Only this way can they look at the work of the administrative offices through the eyes of the lower ranks, favor the way that the lower ranks favor, see as urgent the urgent needs of the lower ranks, and help the lower ranks with their needs and can their decision and direction meet the actual conditions of the lower ranks and be welcomed by the lower ranks, thereby mobilizing officers and men to actively and innovatively work on implementation.Secondly, they must tone down their "posture" of implementation.Don't just give out directions in the administrative offices. You must go and take a walk more often at the frontline of the lower ranks, and you should have a look and ask some questions to see if the decisions made by the administrative offices reflect the reality of the lower ranks, if the work requirements given have been implemented in the lower ranks, to what extent they have been implemented, what other problems have there been during the implementation, what work they need the administrative offices to do, etc.Only by frequently going to the lower ranks and "getting in among them" can you know the real situation, deal with real issues, and seek real results.In a word, take out the "chocks" at the back of the vehicle, keep the "rear wheels" and the "front wheels" on the ground, drive the development of the lower ranks to progress forward both well and quickly.(Work Unit of the Writer: Armed Police, Anhui Command)
