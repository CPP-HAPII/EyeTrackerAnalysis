Tang Qingsong, Special correspondent Yang Zhiwu (Source: PLA Daily 11th edition, Dispatch time: January 16, 2007 07:24)'Tiger Company' Defeated in Five MinutesIntentions to kill lurked on every side of the comprehensive tactical exercise ground of a Guangzhou military region unit.A field maneuver exercise was quietly launched.The officers and soldiers of the First Missile Company that is usually named the Tiger Company got into their hiding position a long time ago and were waiting for the order to attack.Under careful camouflage of the officers and soldiers, the modern anti-tank missile-launching vehicle furnished by the company merged into the green forests.Suddenly, 'enemy' shells whizzed by as if they had eyes.The entire position was thick with gun smoke and recurring noise of explosion broke out.In less than five minutes, the company received the notification from the exercise assessment team, "Your company has been badly beaten by enemy artilleries!"Defeated?The officers and soldiers of the Tiger Company could not understand at all.Everyone had worked hard to do a good job in the camouflage: Thick tree branches and camouflage nets muffled up the equipment. It was even difficult to discover if one passed right beside it without paying attention.However, the criticisms of the assessment team suddenly made them dumbfounded: Why were the newly issued 'fake' gears such as the distortion concealment equipment not used?This question stumped the officers and soldiers of the Tiger Company.Without the interference of the fake equipment to confuse the spurious with the genuine, naturally, enemy's unmanned scout could easily find their hiding place.'Fake' Gears That Should be OverlookedA 'disastrous defeat' that made an indelible impression enabled the officers and soldiers of the First Company of the brigade to understand: In order to have good camouflage training under modern high-tech conditions, one can never be satisfied with traditional camouflage techniques but to use fake gears to their full capabilities.In face of the defeat of the Tiger Company, the brigade leaders also experienced the deplorable consequences caused by the neglect of camouflage equipment.Embarrassing scenes replayed before their eyes one after another:- The issuance of new simulation camouflage equipment such as the distortion concealment equipment and fake targets was indeed very 'impressive' in the inspection by the senior officers and they scored full points.However, once the inspection team left, they were all returned to the storage to 'sleep'.- Some officers and soldiers felt that the camouflage equipment did not worth much and did not maintain and upkeep it properly. As a result, human-caused damages such as scraped paint and bump damages made the fake equipment actually become fake equipment.- In the assessment of the camouflage course conducted by the brigade's organ, the reviewers still used the 'outdated' evaluation standard: If it is unable to be seen, then it passes but if it is able to be seen, then it fails.In the wrap-up meeting, Brigadier Liu Dingkang had profound reflections, "When we engage in concealment and deception, not only do we need to trick ordinary people, we also need to overcome advanced reconnaissance measures of strong enemies. We should never use self-deceiving gimmicks. Putting 'fake equipment' to good use is also the 'magic weapon' to conquer the enemies.Makes all Attempts to Treat 'Fake' as RealAs a result, a training upsurge in 'conducting good camouflage equipment training and treating 'fake' shows as real' quickly emerged within the brigade.The brigade specially invited experts to personally teach the officers and soldiers how to properly maintain and use the camouflage equipment. Meanwhile, it also cancelled the one-sided target of solely pursuing good equipment conditions.The brigade also stepped up efforts in tackling various camouflage equipment strategies and tactics.Based on the characteristics and laws of reconnaissance and surveillance in high-tech battles, they invented a computer-assisted decision-making system that can both design camouflage plans for targets under various backgrounds including different seasons and topographies and provide numerous assisted decisions in camouflage under complex battle situation.The article titled How to Utilize Distortion and Variant Techniques to Conceal the Real and Show the Fake under High-Tech Conditions written by the brigade's armament department was published in an authoritative magazine.At the same time, the brigade has launched solid camouflage equipment training. It holds a concealment and camouflage equipment drill with the entire staff and all equipment once a month. The fake vehicles and fake artilleries that were locked up in the storage before are once again driven into the drill ground.
