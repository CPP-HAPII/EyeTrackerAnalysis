January 13, 2007 09:49Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 13 - (Reporter: Zhou Lei) "The domestication technology of spotted-deer has already matured, but spotted-deer reared at homes are still being listed as a national-class protected animal. But on the contrary, the endangered species arethusa - due to a lack of legal restraint - is still being illicitly and excessively poached." Experts believe that a serious systematic and legal lag exists in China's protection of wildlife.According to experts, the lag in China's laws and regulations has already seriously restrained efforts in protecting wildlife.In addition, the inadequate devotion of funds had also made wildlife protection an excessively difficult task.Yunnan Province Forestry Department Wildlife Protection Office Director Zhao Xiaodong noted that, except for the giant panda, no special judicial interpretation is provided for over 300 key protected wildlife species.Yunnan Province Forestry Department Wildlife Protection Office Deputy Director Qi Yili said no regulation concerning the protection of arethusa has yet to be introduced, due to the differing opinions of the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Forestry Administration on the identification of the plant's properties. Hence there is no legal basis whatsoever for its relevant management. Yet many arethusa are located only in parts of Yunnan Province, and are in a precariously endangered state.Brahm. Postela, a Dutch expert who has been engaged in wildlife protection and community participation projects in Yunnan for several years, believes that although the Chinese government has undertaken great efforts in wildlife protection, the construction of most conservation areas is actually like "an isolated island," lacking an "ecological corridor" for the exchange of gene species. Hence, in this aspect, the Chinese government should bring into better play the enthusiasm of local villagers, instead of just constructing conservation areas with administrative undertones.
