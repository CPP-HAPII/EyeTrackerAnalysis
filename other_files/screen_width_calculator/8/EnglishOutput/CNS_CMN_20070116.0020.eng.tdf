Be practical in solving prominent environmental problems that endanger the health of the public.Fully implement the "Six Water Measures" and the "Five Gas Measures"; concentrate on dealing with illegal waste discharge in drinking water supply conservation areas. Focus on solving hidden pollution dangers presented by petrochemical enterprises that threaten drinking water safety along the coast of big rivers and big river courses. Concentrate on dealing with violations of environmental laws in industrial districts and illegal waste discharge by heavy pollution industries such as those involved in lead and paper manufacturing. Fully wipe out "local policies" that violate local environmental laws and regulations, strictly pursue liabilities for phenomena of known violations of law and administrative omissions, and severely crack down on acts of violation against environmental laws.3. Focus on solving ecological protection problems that affect sustainable growth.Reinforce protection in nature preservation zones, key ecological function reserves, and ecologically fragile areas.

Gradually establish a soil environment protection, supervision, and management system. Strengthen the implementation of the "Environmental Protection Action Plan for a Rural Society with Well-to-Do Life Standard."4. Strictly execute environment impact assessment and the "Three Simultaneous" system.Launch a special investigation on the nationwide environment impact assessment situation. Reinforce environmental management of construction projects for key industries. Start in-depth planning of test points for environment impact assessment. Conscientiously reinforce management of environmental impact assessment qualification. Fulfill the "Seven Promises," and conscientiously increase the implementation rate for environmental impact assessment and "Three Simultaneous."5. Focus on implementing the three major fundamental and strategic projects for environmental protection, namely the nationwide pollution source survey, the study of macro environmental strategies, and the special water project; carry out serious preparation, perform careful planning, and do a good job conscientiously.At the same time, reinforce environmental legislation work, strive hard to solve the "knotty old" problems in enforcing environmental laws, organize large-scale publicity activities related to key work points, strengthen the supervision of public opinions, encourage public participation, and gather the force of the entire society into the practice of promoting a historical change.6. Carry out an in-depth launch of the "Year for Reinforcing Local Environmental Protection Work" activity.Organize and launch a survey on the abilities of nationwide municipal and county environmental protection departments, fully aware of their abilities, and reinforce the development of fundamental abilities. Be firm in changing the situation with "endless paperwork and meetings," reduce quantity, and improve quality. Reorganize evaluation, target achievement, and commendation activities by withdrawing when it is time to withdraw and combining when it is time to combine. Gradually build a long-term mechanism to strengthen established activities.7.
