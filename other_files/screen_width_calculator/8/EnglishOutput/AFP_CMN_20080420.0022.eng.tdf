AFP on the 19th, Estoril, PortugalSwiss tennis master Federer, the world number one, will carry a 9-0 career record into tomorrow's final against Russian player Davydenko at the Estoril Open, seeking to win his first personal championship cup of 2008.Top seed Federer said of his world number four rival: "I know the danger of Nikolay (Davydenko).""I've had several lucky wins against him. It was pretty close at the Roland Garros court in the semi-final last year. I know what a great, great player he is. That's why I'm very proud of my record."Federer, currently being coached by newly-hired Spanish coach Higueras, struggled today to eliminate Germany's world number 104 Gremelmayr 2-6, 7-5, 6-1 to win himself a spot in his first final this season.Since the Masters Cup in November of last year, Federer has not won any championship. Today when playing against Gremelmayr who was playing in his first semi-final, he lost the first set and then quickly picked up his momentum, winning eight of the last nine matches.Davydenko, who earlier beat French player Serra 6-2 easily twice, has won 11 matches in a row including the crown at the Sony Ericsson tennis tournament earlier this month.Davydenko said, he was ready to play against Federer, and "I like it when the match is against me."
