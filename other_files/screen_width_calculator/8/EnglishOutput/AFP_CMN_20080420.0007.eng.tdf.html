New York (AFP), 19th.Today is the three-year anniversary of his duty as Pope Benedict XVI of the Roman Catholic Church. At the same time he has become the first Pope to hold mass in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral.As the Pope slowly walked down the church's central aisle towards the altar, clergymen of churches rose one by one from the benches to kiss the Pope's holy ring.A few minutes before, when the Pope exited from a black limo stopped on Fifth Avenue and walked up a flight of stairs towards the church, a crowd of several hundred crowded around the iron railing of this 150-year old church, erupting in applause.Under the gothic spires, he was welcomed by New York's Mayor Bloomberg, then turned to hold up two hands to salute the crowd.Soon after, to the several hundred clergymen in the church, the Pope said, that only in New York, "A long-term symbol of tolerance, could a middle class kid by the name of Bloomberg grow up and be invited to welcome the Pope."Bloomberg is Jewish. During his six-day visit to the US, the Pope made a special effort to reach out to Jews, including privately meeting with Jewish leaders and becoming the first Pope in history to ever pay a visit to a Jewish synagogue in the US.
