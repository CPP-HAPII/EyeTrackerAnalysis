April 23, 2008(People.com.cn, Apr. 23) The Deniliquin Rice Mill, the largest rice mill in the southern hemisphere, once processed enough grain to meet the daily demand of twenty million people. A six-year drought however has greatly reduced Australia's grain production.The sharp reduction in Australia's rice output is an important factor in the doubling of the price of rice over the past three months.The increase in the price of rice has severely limited exports from the world's largest exporters.Another reason for the souring grain prices to date is that the influence of the drought on rice has severely impacted global production.Many scientists feel that this is the earliest indication that global warming is starting to affect grain production.
