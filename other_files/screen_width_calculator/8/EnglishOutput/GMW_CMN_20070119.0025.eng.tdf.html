Li Zhenzhong 2007-01-19On January 11, the Qingdao Morning News reported: "Those who have caused terrible consequences or a serious negative effect on society must be punished more seriously or with greater severity. In addition, the relevant leaders' responsibilities will be pursued.Typical cases will be openly prosecuted and revealed to the public." This correspondent learned yesterday that the municipal supervision bureau, the office of the municipal committee for spiritual civilization development, and the office of the municipal committee for the comprehensive management of social security jointly published a "Communiqué on Better Educating Civil Servants to Obey Laws and Regulations and Increased Strictness in Civil Servant Monitoring and Management," requiring the governments of all districts and municipality, all departments in the municipal government and all municipally-controlled work units to strictly forbid civil servants from drunk driving.In the communiqué it says that recently there have been occasional instances of problems of driving in contravention of regulations or drunk driving among the civil servants of our city's government departments. This has had an adverse effect on the general public.That is to say that as the New Year approaches, civil servants are busy toasting the revolution. But these drinks are not on their own tab; nor are the drinks on relatives' tabs. They are drinks on the tabs of the departments they control; drinks on the tabs of the departments they have connections with; and drinks on the tab of the ordinary people. Only when they have these drinks coming from all sides will civil servants get drunk every day toasting the revolution. However, drinking these toasts to the revolution, apart from damaging the image of the party and damaging stomachs, has also caused traffic incidents, directly causing new traffic accidents and casualties for the public. The disaster of these little drinks is now no longer as simple as causing harm to their own stomachs, or causing harm to the image of the party. These toasts to the revolution will cause new extreme harm to the arms and legs of some ordinary people. Isn't this new damage a new variety of bureaucratic damage?In the document it stipulates that particularly for those who are engaged in drinking and drunk driving, in addition to administrative penalties by law, their disciplinary responsibilities will be pursued in accordance with the relevant regulations.But this writer is worried about the problems of corruption hidden in the banquets that lie behind these drunk civil servants. A retired cadre basically isn't invited for dinner by anyone. A household on the minimum livelihood insurance benefits has even less money to go and drink themselves silly in a star-rated hotel. Drunk driving and accidents involving civil servants are just an outward manifestation. Why, then, don't the disciplinary inspection department and the spiritual civilization development office pay any attention to the deeper crisis behind these toasts to the revolution?When pulling the arrow out of someone who is injured by an arrow, if a surgeon only pulls out the outermost part of the shaft, isn't this just a doctor who can only sell sticking plasters but can't cure diseases?Isn't this a doctor who tries to scrape up a reputation without doing anything?Why don't the "doctors" in the relevant supervisory departments, spiritual civilization office and comprehensive management office go and investigate the corrupt causes behind the civil servants' drunk driving?If they could find the root cause of this disease and cure the disease, then which "host's" drinks would be especially reserved for public servants?
