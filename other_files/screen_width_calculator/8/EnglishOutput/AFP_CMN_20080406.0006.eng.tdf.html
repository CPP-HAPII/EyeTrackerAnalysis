AFP on the 5th, American Air Force OneThe White House stated today that US President Bush and Russian President Putin are not expected to reach an agreement on the American missile defense plan during their talks to be held in Sochi this weekend.White House spokesperson Ms. Perino told the media reporters accompanying President Bush on the visit: "After the Sochi talks conclude, we still must add even more effort."Bush is scheduled to have talks with Putin later today at his Black Sea resort in Sochi.Perino said: "We remain in the initial stages of this discussion."Even though Russia has expressed grave concerns, NATO allies at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit held earlier in Romania's capital supported the plan to build a missile defense system that Bush has been promoting.The US has said that it plans to deploy missiles within the borders of Poland and deploy radars within the borders of the Czech Republic, asserting that it is necessary to push this plan forward in order to resist the threats posed by "rouge nations" such as Iran.Russia has on the other hand stated that this plan directly threatens Russia's security.Perino also said that "it would be too early" to expect that an agreement could be reached on the missile defense plan at the Sochi talks, but there has already been progress.She said: "I believe that we have already made substantial progress in convincing Russians that this system is not directed towards Russia and that Russia is not the enemy."She also said: "We believe that it is possible for America, Russia, and Europe to work together in cooperation. We have always tried to follow those guidelines and incorporate measures for transparency and establishing mutual trust."
