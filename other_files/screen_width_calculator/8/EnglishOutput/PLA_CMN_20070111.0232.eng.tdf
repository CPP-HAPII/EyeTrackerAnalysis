(Source: Xinhua News Agency Issue time: 2007-01-11 17:34)Xinhua News Agency, London, January 10 - (Reporter Ge Qiufang) Researchers from the University of Portsmouth in England are developing a new essential airplane components test method to guarantee safer travel by air.On the 10th, according to the introductions of Professor Tong Jie who was responsible for this research in the university, the research team was developing this method through using a computer modeling method, studying the changes under flight pressure of the engine, and other essential components.Tong Jie said that the metal components inside the engine need to withstand high pressure and large vibrations while the airplane is flying; therefore, the small cracking of these components due to metal fatigue must be clearly understood.In the usual circumstances, the technicians keep abreast of these cracks through regular inspections and machinery tests, and the prompt replacements of possible problem components.The cost of this kind of inspection is high. This is also one of the main causes of the current expensive airplane ticket price.Tong Jie said that they plan to cooperate with material scientists from the University of Siegen in Germany using a high-performance transmission electron microscope to inspect the fault structure, other slight changes in these components, and obtain data. Afterward, they will make precise models and accurately forecast the metal component's fatigue degree.This can not only enhance flight security, but it can also reduce the service cost and make air travel safer and cheaper.This project has obtained funding from the Royal Society.(end)
