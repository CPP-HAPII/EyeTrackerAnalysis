This is the biggest mistake Westerners make.Rogge said that dialogue with China must be carried out under the preconditions of "respect and quiet."Forcing different opinions on others can only produce the opposite result."Starting from the French Revolution, it took 200 years for the West to develop into today's model. China did not take its first steps until 1949."Rogge said: "We only gave up colonial rule 40 years ago, let's be a little bit more modest."Rogge said: "We have an obligation to give China more time the Olympics will have a positive effect on Chinese society."Also, Rogge, meanwhile, personally said that his own relationships with Beijing are very good.
