AFP on the 13th, RomeItaly's parliamentary election kicks off today, with outsiders expecting conservative leader Berlusconi to beat his center-left rival Veltroni to become a third-term prime minister.Poll stations across the country opened at 8:00 a.m., accepting ballots from the public till 10:00 p.m. They will be open again at 7:00 tomorrow morning till 3:00 in the afternoon.Against a backdrop of a slowing economy, years of political instability, and social unrest, when the last public opinion survey within the time limit stipulated by the Electoral Law was conducted two weeks ago, about one third of the fifty million voters were still undecided on the candidate they supported.The survey shows that 71-year-old Berlusconi is expected to win the general elections by a margin of 6-7%.Since his campaign started in February this year, Berlusconi has been maintaining a two-digit lead over 52-year-old Veltroni.Imitating the "Straight Talk Express" of McCain, the American Republican presidential candidate, Veltroni made his bus tour all over the country, urging voters to "turn the page" of the older generation represented by Berlusconi. Meanwhile, Berlusconi has accused this former mayor of Rome as the remnant poison from the communist party.52-year-old Veltroni, smart and supple, has been a veteran in Italian politics. He entered the political arena as a radical communist youth in the 1970s, while 71-year-old Berlusconi entered the political circles in 1993.No matter who wins tomorrow's election, he will have to deal with a stagnant economy, the public dissatisfaction with politicians, and the lack of efficiency in the parliament.It is worrisome that if the margin is too narrow, Berlusconi's People of Freedom party in the Senate will surely face instability, like the situation that led to the collapse of the Prodi administration after being in power for twenty months.
