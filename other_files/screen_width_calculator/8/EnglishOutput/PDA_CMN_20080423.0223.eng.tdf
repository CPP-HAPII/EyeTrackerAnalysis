April 23, 2008.After two days of discussion, the European Parliament plenary session passed the final deployment plan for Europe's Galileo global satellite navigation system (abbreviated as the Galileo project) on the 23rd here. This signals the official start of the Galileo project's six-year infrastructure construction phase.According to the final deployment plan, the Galileo project will be established in two phases: the construction phase from 2008 to 2013 and the operational phase from 2013 onward.The European Union will contribute 3.4 billion euros to the construction phase to be used for completing the Galileo project's space and land infrastructure construction, including the launch of 30 satellites.All of the project's contracts are broken down into six types, including land infrastructure, control center, satellite manufacturing, launch equipment, system software and other tasks. Companies from European Union member countries may bid, but no company can become the prime contractor for more than two types of contracts.The Galileo project is one of the strategic scientific research projects officially approved by the European Union in 2002. Its goal is to build a satellite navigation system that covers the entire globe. Its ground positioning service error will not be greater than 1 meter.However, due to funding and other factors, the development of the Galileo project has not gone smoothly. Up to now, there has been only one test satellite launch, at the end of 2005. (Reporters Liu Xiurong, Zhang Bihong)
