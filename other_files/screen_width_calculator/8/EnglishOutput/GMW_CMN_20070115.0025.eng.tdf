Jiang Wei, January 15, 2007The Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (abbreviated as "ETIM"), which was announced as a terrorist group by the United Nations on September 11, 2002, sent its backbone members into the country and gathered a band of violent terrorists to sneak into China's Pamirs Mountains area to set up a terrorism training camp and carry out terrorism trainings. They were wiped out by Xinjiang police on January 5, 2007.Since the world started carrying out large-scale anti-terrorism activities in recent years, this is the biggest terrorist training camp that was found and destroyed within our country to date.On the one hand, it shows the firm determination and crackdown force of the party and the government in fighting against terrorism, and on the other hand, it is also reminding us how far exactly terrorism is away from us.From the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York to the chain explosion in Madrid, Al Qaeda's activities today are not only savage but all-pervasive as well. Especially in the Middle East region, and particularly from Iraq, there is bloody news almost every day.Al Qaeda's terrorist activities have become a serious hidden danger that threatens the safety of the world, nations, and human beings.The safety situation of our country is not optimistic, either. Separatist forces, such as the Falun Gong cult, Xinjiang independence movement, Tibet independence movement, and Chinese democracy movement, dream of breaking up the nation and overturning the people's regime at all times.The ETIM group in Xinjiang in particular is not only a branch organization of Al Qaeda in China, but also specializes in violent sabotages such as assassination and explosion.This time they actually dared to set up a terrorist training camp in our country, meaning that they are now gradually penetrating into mainland China and are getting closer and closer to us. If we lower our guard regarding this, we will be deceived and put at a great disadvantage.The fact that an ETIM terrorism training camp was wiped out by the Xinjiang police has already reminded us that when it comes to preventing and suppressing sabotage activities of terrorist groups, not only are the party and country responsible, all levels of party committees and governments are responsible as well; not only are public security organs responsible, all enterprises and public service units are responsible as well; and not only are social administrators responsible, it is even more the responsibility of the commoners.The party and country focus a lot on anti-terrorism and have signed joint anti-terrorism treaties and agreements with the United Nations and some neighboring countries. However, judging from the domestic situation, the circumstances on handling terrorism are still not optimistic. First of all, there is not enough mental preparation.Some people believe that anti-terrorism is the responsibility of the higher authorities and has nothing to do with themselves, whereas others are blindly optimistic by believing that terrorism is serious overseas while there is peace in the country. There are also some who lower their guard and so on because they believe that a few terrorists are only fooling around at the borders and cannot create any major trouble. All these are extremely destructive.Second, is that some local party committees and governments are not taking this seriously.Some local party committees and governments in mainland China in particular are not placing enough importance on preventing and suppressing terrorism. They not only fail to establish specialized anti-terrorism teams, they also do not have contingency plans for dealing with sudden anti-terrorism incidents. Even if they have, it is only for show; they will probably be caught unprepared in the event of a terrorist incident. Third, is that the security measures of enterprises and public service units are still not up to standard.With more international contact and a greater scope of reform and opening-up, people who enter the country become complicated. If security measures are not up to standard, it may give terrorists a chance to exploit it.However, judging from the security measures of some units, there still exist many evident loopholes.For instance, the previous case of a child climbing on an airplane wing secretly and falling to his death in Chengdu Shuangliu Airport shows that the defense line is that weak.If important units and departments, such as transportation, shipping, airline, and railway, do not have strict security measures, they will possibly make it easy for terrorists to enter the country and carry out sabotages.We are currently building a harmonious socialist society, and when the situation is good, we still need to see the existing lurking dangers.High alertness must be maintained, especially against terrorist sabotage. Once there is sabotage carried out by terrorists, it must be firmly, fully, and promptly eliminated, because terrorism is not far away from us.
