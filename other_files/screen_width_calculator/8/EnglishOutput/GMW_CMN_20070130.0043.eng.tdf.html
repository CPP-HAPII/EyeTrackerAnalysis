Xie Fende 2007-01-30The Spring Festival used to be a holiday with the most cultural connotations and traditional charm, and it has been with us for several thousand years.The Spring Festival custom of letting off firecrackers sets off quiet villages in a lively and exciting way and allows people to ring out the old and ring in the new in a lively atmosphere, letting people feel the festivity of the New Year in the sound of the lively firecrackers.Owing to the danger to safety posed by the letting off of firecrackers, various cities of all sizes banned the letting off of firecrackers in succession. Admittedly, it was safer, but there was no New Year feeling any more.Pasting up New Year couplets, the activity that has the most cultural connotations, has also gradually lost currency as people's living conditions have improved with the construction of tall buildings and large houses.The New Year pictures sold in every large supermarket today are prettier than before, but people, finding nowhere to put them up, increasingly do without them.I remember when I was little, my parents and I had to go to many places to buy a pretty New Year picture. I can still see vividly in my mind's eye how I busied myself spreading out the paper and pouring ink for the gentleman who wrote the couplets and arguing with my brothers where to paste the upper and lower lines of the couplets. Back then, as soon you stepped outside, you could see carefully balanced and neatly written couplets, the best model from which to learn to read.Preparing dumplings seems to be a northern custom.For my hometown, the family meal on the eve of the New Year was extremely important.In those years of material shortage, no matter how poor the family was, our parents would always go to great lengths to prepare us a family feast on the eve of the New Year.You had to pay attention to many things at the dinner table on the eve of the New Year as well.Our parents admonished us to say lucky phrases at the start of the New Year. We couldn't mention death or any other unlucky words.On the eve of the New Year, our parents would utter a lucky phrase while eating each dish.For example, when eating cabbage, my mother would say, "this year, we have a hundred dishes to eat, and next year we will have a thousand." For green vegetables, "clean and fresh, safe and sound."During the meal on the eve of the New Year, our parents would let the children off the leash, and allow us children to drink some weak alcohol.The thing we looked forward to most as children during the New Year was all sorts of activities from Chinese New Year's Day to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month.On the first day of the lunar year, while still half dreaming, we could hear the deafening sound of gongs and drums. Everyone in the village would set off in the direction of the noise. Sure enough, the neighboring village's troupe of dragon lantern dancers and stilt walkers was arriving. Amid the lively beating of gongs and drums, there were also activities in which the whole village, men and women, young and old, all took part, as happy as could be.Afterwards, every village sang operas and put on make-up for the performance.Although this grassroots culture could not compare with the grand show of the Spring Festival Evening Gala, the villagers had a good time watching it.The primitive local operas put on by the villagers, born and bred there, talked about people and events at hand and sang about the personal feelings of farmers; they were far more entertaining and enjoyable than watching the performance by big stars.Now, in material terms, people have prospered. People no longer hanker after food and clothing.With the increase in the number of films and the spread of television and computers, people's cultural lives ought to be rich and varied, but, how many people can personally take part in these events? At most, they can just be spectators.These artificially created lively scenes shown on channels controlled by electronics and remote controls are unable to connect with people's hearts. They cannot allow people to personally experience and take part in the fun.In short, the Spring Festival calls for culture and calls for the din of traditional culture.The Spring Festival calls for our participation. Maybe a tiny riddle on a lantern can inspire people's minds; an opera that suits both refined and common tastes can send us back to our childhood; and a dragon dance performance can make people all the more reexamine this traditional holiday, the Spring Festival.
