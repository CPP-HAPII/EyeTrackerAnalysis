Port-au-Prince, the 20th (AFP)Haitian President Preval today announced a plan to lower food prices by 15% in order to stem deadly food riots that have already resulted in the dismissal of Prime Minister Alexis.More than a week after riots broke out in Haiti because of sharp increases in food and fuel prices, Preval today announced the above measures accompanied by food importers.According to unofficial statistics, the riots have resulted in at least five dead and 200 injured.As Preval made his speech, the National Assembly voted to dismiss Prime Minister Alexis in response to the crisis.Sixteen senators in the upper house unanimously passed a condemnation of Alexis that rebuked him for being unable to meet the demands of Haiti's 8.5 million people.Approximately 80% of Haiti's people survive on less than two US dollars a day.Senators belonging to Preval's party were not present for the vote, but Preval had said a bit earlier that he would not block an attempt to dismiss Alexis.He agreed to cooperate with the two chambers of the National Assembly in seeking a replacement.Preval said, "If the National Assembly dismisses the prime minister, I will consult with the leaders of the two chambers in accordance with the requirements of the constitution in order to appoint a new prime minister, since no party in the assembly has a majority. "He also defended Alexis, saying faced with the global increase in food prices, Alexis had spared no effort to cope, and to put all the blame on his shoulders was "not fair."Preval also announced at a press conference in Port-au-Prince that the price of a 50kg package of white rice would be lowered by eight US dollars (about NT$240).The price of a 50kg package of rice has doubled in the space of a week to US$70.Preval said, "The government had agreed to this measure because the international community had donated US$3 million."He also said the government would also intensify efforts to encourage the production of more grain.
