He stated that grain must be ensured, as having grain means having security.At the edge of a field in Datun village, Ren county, Hebei, Wen Jiabao and farmers discussed the farming work of topdressing and irrigating.When some farmers reported that the prices of fertilizer and other farming supplies had risen too quickly, Wen Jiabao said: "I'd say this is mainly because the price of oil has risen too quickly; we can only give farmers subsidies.Why has recently the subsidy for agricultural means of production risen from 17 yuan to 40 yuan? This is exactly used to subsidize farmers and lighten your burden.Looking at it now, everyone's mood about planting grain is still generally stable.If you look at the world situation, everyone still must understand."Wen Jiabao also said: "Now the rise in international grain prices is also rapid; supply and demand have tightened.Our nation is populous with 1.3 billion people, and we can only rely on ourselves for food.Relying on any other country wouldn't work.So back to what we have said, we still must ensure grain here."When some farmers worried whether policies that benefit farmers would change, Wen Jiabao said: "They won't change!These policies not only won't change, we are also thinking what policies should be added."In Shilipu village, Shahe city, Wen Jiabao said while chatting with villagers that currently the nation still has grain reserve, equivalent to 40% of the annual grain consumption."I made some inquiries just now, and farmers all have grain stored in their own homes."Wen Jiabao said, "This makes me feel even more assured.Not only the country has grain reserve; there is also grain reserve in all the (farmers') houses. The nation is secure, and to have grain is to have security!"Wen Jiabao and his entourage also inspected the feed production companies, domestic poultry breeding companies, instant noodles production companies, as well as farming supplies, chemical fertilizers, and comprehensive service stations, etc in the two areas of Xingtai and Handan in Hebei Province.
