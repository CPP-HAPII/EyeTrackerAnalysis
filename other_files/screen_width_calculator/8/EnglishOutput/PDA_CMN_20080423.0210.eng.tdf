April 23, 2008Two days before the "general election" in Taiwan, a Taiwanese man with the surname "Tsai" phoned the service office of a Democratic Progressive Party alderman, Wang Ding-yu, and threatened to make Frank Hsieh "eat a bullet." He was taken into custody for 4 days for criminal intimidation.Since the man with the surname Tsai deeply repented and his viciousness was mild, yesterday, the prosecutor gave him a one year suspended prosecution.According to a report from Taiwan's media, the man with the surname Tsai said that his wording during the phone call was meant to tease the Democratic Progressive Party by saying that if they want to win the election they will have to remake a "March 19th" incident again.The prosecutor thinks that although the man with the surname Tsai offended Taiwan's "criminal law" of intimidation, after his offence he admitted his mistake and was taken into custody. Therefore he was given a suspended prosecution.
