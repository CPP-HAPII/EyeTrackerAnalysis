Wu Renshou, January 29, 2007At the award ceremony of the Three Agricultural Figures 2006Hou Yaohua got down on his knees at the feet of Lu Yongkang because he was moved by his deeds.Lu Yongkang is a native of Yangfu Village, Sandushui Autonomous County, Qiannan, Guizhou.He suffered from polio that caused muscular atrophy below his knees when he was nine months old. He lost his walking ability as a result. All the teachers at the Kongrong Primary School in the village left when he was 20 years old. Lu Yongkang determined to take over the teaching job. He thus became a community-supported teacher since then.At that time, many students had quit school. In order to ask the students to return, he used planks, old basketball, waste tires, and wires to make a pair of 'boat shoes' that weighted 2 kilos by himself. He tied them to his knees and leaned on wooden sticks then started a difficult course of persuading people to attend school.His 'kneel to walk' moved the villagers. His students increased to 50 in the second term.Three years later, the primary school had an unprecedented student number of 150.During these 38 years, the extreme cold and heat, the hails, heavy downpours, and snowstorms have left many scars on Lu Yongkang's body but they have not weakened his devotion to the teachers and the educational cause of the Party.With his persistence, he kneels on the platform to transmit wisdom and impart knowledge day after day and crawls to advance on mountain paths year after year to conduct home visits from village to village. He thus created the miracle of having 100 percent enrollment rate of children in the poor mountain region of Shui Town and fostered generation after generation of new blood who can change the poor and backward situation of his hometown.He also 'changed the school from community-supported to public' through examinations.Lu Yongkang is a Shui nationality man who kneels to work but commands admiration from people who stand. He struggles with fate with his handicapped body and delivers the light of knowledge to the children in the mountains with his lifelong experiences.During his 38-year of teaching, he has been faithful to the Party's educational undertaking. He makes unceasing efforts to improve himself and has neither complaints nor regret in his devotion to the education of minorities in the mountain region. In his 21 years of joining the Party, he has interpreted the advanced nature of the Communist Party with his special life course and manifested the spiritual ethos of selfless devotion of Communist members and the quality of time of the new Communist Party.He is like a 'red candle'. He kindles himself to burn in the mountain region and the hearts of the students, parents, and people.Even though this candlelight is weak, he lights up the future of the mountain village.He put himself on the big stage of mountain region development, thus realizing bigger value of life.Lu Yongkang is indeed a primary school teacher who deserves people's respect and sincere admiration. His spirit and perseverance, together with his unyielding struggle makes people sigh with wonder.However, while he commands people's admiration and be gratefulness, what he does more is to stimulate people to ponder the value of life and existence and the worries about rural education nowadays:First, what drives Lu Yongkang to 'kneel to walk' and 'kneel to teach' with amazing will power and keeps kneeling for 38 years?It is not difficult to find from his deeds that the answer is as simple as a single word - love!Education is the project of molding the soul. Without love, there is no education. This is almost a consensus among educators at all times and in all countries.Love enables students to thrive. Such love is selfless and unadulterated. It is essential for the molding of bright minds.Same as all other children, sunshine is indispensable to the growth of the children in the mountains while love is the sunshine that Teacher Lu Yongkang spreads.If we say that love is a calling and an inspiration, then, we hope that the infatuated love of Lu Yongkang for his profession and his affection for his students can urge more people to show concern and support for the education in the poverty-stricken regions in the west and inspire more insightful people, especially ardent youth, to teach and to support local educational undertakings in the west to enable the red candle spirit to light up the rural and mountain village and pass the torch of learning from generation to generation.Second, society has indeed moved forward nowadays but the situation of rural education is not optimistic and worrisome.There are still many rural schools with poor conditions and a lack of qualified teachers in the poverty-stricken regions in the western part of our country. Parents are expecting fair education while children are wishing for 'the same blue sky'.What can we offer them?Only high-quality education.Not only should we increase investment to upgrade school buildings and improve facilities, more importantly, we should enhance the building of teachers, heighten quality of teachers, encourage sound teaching ethics, and advocate devotion of love because noble teaching ethics with love as its key element is also an important resource of quality education.Only when this resource is well cultivated and developed can more teachers and students in rural and mountain regions grow together and face the challenges of Chinese educational reform in the 21st century.Third, due to the extremely unfair allocation of educational resources between urban and rural areas nowadays, in order to change the existing backward situation of rural education and enable children in the mountain region to have books to study and school to attend, it still largely requires more rural teachers who stand fast quietly.Standing fast is a character of resilience, a spirit of devotion, and a virtue of dedication to one's work. Without the many rural teachers who stand fast, there will be no vitalization of rural education. If rural education cannot catch up, then education in China is handicapped and things such as tackling the 'two basics' are simply empty words.It is precisely based on this significance that we hope more rural teachers can continue to stand fast and conscientiously shoulder the lofty responsibilities and glorious mission that the times bestow on them. This is a precious resource. Government and relevant departments should not neglect its existence. They should fully utilize it and allow it to play a bigger role.On the one hand, they should take the initiative to show concern for the situation of 'teachers who stand fast' in rural areas and help them resolve some realistic issues so that they can teach worry-free and contribute more to the education in the mountain region. On the other hand, they should encourage willing minds to take root in education in the mountain region with policies, measures, and mechanism to expand the ranks of teachers who stand fast and give more hope to the mountain people and earnest protection to rural education.Moreover, in education investments, it should truly slant toward poverty-stricken villages to accelerate changes in rural education infrastructure and create necessary conditions for educating people and imparting book knowledge.
