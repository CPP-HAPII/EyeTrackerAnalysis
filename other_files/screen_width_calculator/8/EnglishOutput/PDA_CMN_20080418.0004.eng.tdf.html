April 18, 2008A British media report said yesterday saying the 56 year old Russian president, Putin, and 24 year old Russian artistic gymnastics world champion and model Alina Kabaeva will get married.This gossip of a romantic story made people feel not too decent because Putin did not officially announce his separation with his 50-year-old wife, Ludmilla.But the British media said that Putin, who always keeps his private life far out of the spotlight, divorced his wife two months ago.A Russian Web site even said that Putin and Kabaeva were seen kissing in a Moscow restaurant.A report from the British media said that the news of Putin wooing Kabaeva, a member of Russia's parliament, has been circulating among Russia's citizens for awhile, but only now was revealed by a Russian newspaper.The report quoted a St. Petersburg banquet planner saying he is currently applying to organize Putin's luxurious wedding that will be held in St. Petersburg.According to reports, the wedding will be held on June 15th, over one month after Putin steps down as Russian president.One of the most popular rumors is that Putin and Kabaeva will have the wedding inside the Russian Czar's Summer Residence, Pushkin city. Inside this castle is Yekaterina Palace, Alexander Palace, and other buildings.The media also said the Kremlin is currently still declining to discuss this news.Born in 1983, in what is now Uzbekistan's capital city of Tashkent, Kabaeva represented Russia in the Sydney and Athens Olympics. She was also the artistic gymnastics champion in the Athens Olympics. She had sexy pictures of her taken for a magazine, only wrapped in a piece of fur.
