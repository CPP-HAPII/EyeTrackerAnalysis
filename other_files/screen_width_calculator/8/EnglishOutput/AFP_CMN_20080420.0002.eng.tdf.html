Berlin (AFP), 19th.After the break down of the fourth round of negotiations between Germany's service industry union and Deutsche Post Group's management last night, today the union called on the group's workers to go on strike starting on May 2nd for an unlimited time.The service industry union said the strike's details will be finalized by next weekend.Earlier on, Deutsche Post's personnel department manager Scheuerle issued a statement saying if the union doesn't oppose a work hour increase, this group is already prepared to continue negotiations.Scheuerle said the union must give concessions to maintain the group's competitiveness, but the union spokesperson Ishmael said management's attitude is to "deliberately incite conflict."The union also demands a salary increase of seven percent, and a guarantee of employment for Deutsche Post's 133-thousand employees until 2011.Deutsche Post proposed a salary increase of 5.5 percent for the coming two years and an employment guarantee but employee weekly work time must be raised by half an hour.The service industry union also called for bus, subway and trolley maintenance yards within Berlin's transport system, as well as vehicle gas station and cleaning employees to go on strike on the weekend.
