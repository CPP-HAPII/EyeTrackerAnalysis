There will be 10 bedrooms in the house, a family movie theater, and a swimming pool.This house will begin construction this June. It is estimated to be finished around next August.Besides the land value, this house's construction cost is approximately $40 million US dollars.The house's price is $16 million US Dollars higher than the English mansion which last year "Forbes" ranked first as the most expensive home in the world.Blixseth has already drawn protests from environmentalist organizations for building the Yellowstone Club at the Bozeman entrance to Yellowstone National Park.
