Some cadres assigned to help-to-build just came to the camp to wander around and take a look.There were some whose train of thought did not lead them to be helpful or take practical steps to help-to-build, but rather use their energy to write documents designed to garner them attention.In this way, the concrete results of assigning cadres to help-to-build were not obvious.The corps party committee analyzed the situation and concluded that the fundamental cause of the above-described phenomenon was that the responsibilities of cadres assigned to help-to-build were not clear: whether or not they helped, the result was the same, and it was all the same regardless of the quality of their help.For this reason, the Help-to-build Accountability System was born.They stipulated that organization cadres sent to assist in help-to-build must have clear task targets. Whoever helps in help-to-build is responsible, and if the task goal is not realized, the cadre will have to bear responsibility.Cash rewards and punishments will link the results of help-to-build to the visiting cadre's promotion and rank. If the unit is not assessed as advanced, the corresponding visiting cadres for help-to-build cannot be assessed as advanced.Marked results have be gained from assigning responsibility.Chief of Reconnaissance Zhang Jianjun, and Cadre Chief Song Shaotao last year each took on a company's help-to-build duties. At year end, the two company's had entered into the ranks of the advanced, and the two men were also assessed as advanced individuals.
