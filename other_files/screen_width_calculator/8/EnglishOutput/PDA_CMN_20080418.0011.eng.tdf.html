April 18, 2008.At a news conference on the 17th, U.S.A Secretary of State Rice said that according to the results of the meeting of U.S. and North Korean representatives in Singapore, the U.S. plans to send somebody to visit North Korea soon to carry out a final negotiation regarding North Korea's complete nuclear program list.If the negotiation develops smoothly, North Korea may submit a complete nuclear program list by the end of the month.Rice said: "Have we already made progress on the North Korean nuclear issue through the six-party talk framework? Yes.Do we still have reason to continue being cautious and doubtful? Yes."Rice expressed praise for the six-party talk mechanism. She said that talks under this type of framework resulted in the finding of common ground between each of the attending parties for pushing the Korean peninsula to denuclearization and preventing nuclear proliferation.At that day's press conference, Rice did not answer as to what specific issues there are with North Korea's nuclear disarmament process.Yesterday, a U.S. State Department official said that the U.S. is currently establishing a new mechanism to be used to carefully scrutinize all declarations about North Korea's nuclear weapon list.Media here commented that this obviously hints that the U.S. will probably receive the full nuclear list submitted by North Korea very soon.(Reporter Qiu Hongpo)
