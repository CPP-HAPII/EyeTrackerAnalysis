April 18, 2008Today, at Taiwan's legislature's relevant department, Nationalist Party "legislative member" Chiang Yi-Hsiung said that the Taiwanese Minister of Education, Tu Cheng-sheng, found an excuse to not attend meetings 12 times this year and avoided supervision.In order to make officials keep their guard up, he will ask the Nationalist Party team to sue Tu Cheng-sheng for his contempt of the legislature and neglect of duty.According to a CCTV report, Taiwan's "Legislative Education and Culture Committee" heard the advanced education test enrolment's current situation and self-criticism. The chairman of the meeting Chiang Yi-Hsiung said the committee asked Tu Cheng-sheng to do an administrative report on Taiwan's current important education policies many times, but Tu Cheng-sheng always excused his absence on the grounds of "having other important official work." Within the year his record of not attending meetings without obtaining permission for a vacation reached 12.Chiang Yi-Hsiung stressed that because Tu Cheng-sheng's conduct is purposely avoiding "legislative" examination, it is clearly illegal.In order to make the administrative officials keep their guard up, he called on the Nationalist Party team to sue Tu Cheng-sheng.
