BRASILIA, 13th (AFP).The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) will hold a Latin American conference next week in Brasilia, with one of the main topics of discussion being strategies to develop biofuels without sacrificing grain supply.FAO studies show that with both demand and price for grain rising sharply in developing countries, arable land is being transformed into highly-profitable biofuel terrain, and that interest in this is also rising steadily.Brazil has a leading role in the debate, because it is a major agricultural and biofuel exporting country.The FAO's representative for Latin America and the Caribbean, Graziano, is himself Brazilian.He said, even though "there is no absolute truth with respect to biofuels, they can still have a positive or negative influence on food security and the environment, depending on how they are developed."Currently, he said, the grain industry "is facing speculative attack", because low stocks and demand have made the industry appear more fragile, and has also made grain more precious.Brazil and certain countries that benefit from exports have been making additional profits.But according to a report on biofuel production and food security that will be issued at the conference, FAO has found this situation very volatile.The report details opinions for and against the use of crops to make fuels, along with the scale of exchanges, the systems used and market structures for handling the products.But the report is not all negative. The report points out that, if appropriately applied, the biofuel plan would bring benefits to Latin America's family-run farms.Brazilian President Lula denied the rise in food prices was linked to biofuels and urged "developed countries to take responsibility and lower agricultural subsidies distort developing countries."The FAO conference will be attended by ministers and senior officials from 33 countries.
