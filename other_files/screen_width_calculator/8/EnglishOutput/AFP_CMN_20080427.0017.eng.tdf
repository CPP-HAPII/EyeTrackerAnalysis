SEOUL, 26th (AFP)North Korean state media have reported that North Korea rejected today South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's proposal that liaison offices be established in the two countries' capitals, claiming the proposal was a cheap, insincere trick aimed at "preventing reunification".Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers Party, said, "This is not some brand-new idea. Some presidents before Lee Myung-bak, in order to permanently split the Korean Peninsula, also made similar proposals, but all were 'thrown into the trashcan'."The newspaper described Lee Myung-bak's proposal as "a superficial strategy to evade responsibility for straining relations between the two Koreas."The newspaper said, "Lee Myung-bak must stop such cheap, insincere tricks and return to the spirit of June 15."This refers to the June 15 North-South Declaration on Peace and Reconciliation.In the 1990s, South Korea has also proposed setting up liaison offices in each other's capital in the past, but North Korea rejected the proposals.The two sides have liaison offices in the Panmunjom Truce Village.Following ten years of the "Sunshine Policy" on exchanges pursued by two Liberal Party South Korean presidents, Lee Myung-bak of the Conservative Party has taken a more hard-line stance since he took office on February 25. This has angered North Korea.North Korea has suspended all dialogue with South Korea, and has called Lee Myung-bak a "warmonger-like" traitor.
