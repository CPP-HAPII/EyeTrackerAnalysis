CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	98.105	101.934	speaker#1	female	native	Hello viewers. Welcome to Across Strait of CCTV Chinese International Channel.	1	1	1	report	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	101.934	117.653	speaker#1	female	native	In the 2008 Taiwan election, Ma Ying-jeou, the Mainlander candidate of the Kuomintang, scored a landslide victory over Frank Hiseh, candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party, a so-called "native" in Taiwan. Taiwan media offered an analysis by saying that it fully manifests that the ethnic card that the Democratic Progressive Party repeatedly plays in the election has lost its effectiveness on Ma Ying-jeou this time.	1	1	2	report	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	117.653	129.355	speaker#1	female	native	Then, what ethnic groups exist in Taiwan society? Why is there conflict between the natives and the Mainlanders? Today, by means of satellite connection, we will invite two guests from Taiwan to explore this topic with us.	1	1	3	report	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	129.355	135.762	speaker#1	female	native	One is Mr. Cheng Youping, professor at the National Taipei University. Another one is Taiwan current affairs commentator Mr. Chang Chi-kai. How are you two?	1	1	4	report	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	135.762	137.481	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	Hello host, hello viewers.	1	2	5	report	statement

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	138.882	144.117	speaker#1	female	native	Uh, first, before we get into our discussion on today's topic, let's watch a short film.	1	4	7	report	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	144.117	152.415	speaker#4	female	native	In the 2008 leadership election in Taiwan region, Ma Ying-jeou, a Kuomintang figure who has always been attacked by the Democratic Progressive Party as the representative of Mainlanders, won.	1	5	8	report	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	152.415	160.751	speaker#4	female	native	Taiwan media commentaries argued that the victory of Ma Ying-jeou implies that the ethnic card that the Democratic Progressive Party is best at playing in elections has now failed.	1	5	9	report	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	160.751	166.094	speaker#4	female	native	Ma Ying-jeou also appealed for harmony among ethnic groups in Taiwan in his victory speech.	1	5	10	report	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	166.094	178.493	speaker#4	female	native	The China Times in Taiwan also conducted a poll about the ethnic issue after the election. The result showed that 61 percent of the people believed that the victory of Ma Ying-jeou would quell the ethnic rift.	1	5	11	report	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	178.493	202.899	speaker#4	female	native	According to understanding, after the retreat in defeat of the Kuomintang to Taiwan in 1949, the so-called "four major ethnic groups", namely the Minnan people, the Mainlanders, the Hakkas, and the Aborigines were formed in Taiwan. The conflict among these four ethnic groups is known as the ethnic conflict in Taiwan. Every time there is an election, the Democratic Progressive Party will claim to be the natives and attack the Kuomintang by calling them the Mainlanders in order to gain the support of voters and instigate ethnic conflict.	1	5	12	report	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	202.899	218.367	speaker#1	female	native	We know that the newly elected uh, Taiwan region leader Ma Ying-jeou was born in Hong Kong in 1950. He went to Taiwan when he was one year old. Well, many supporters of the Democratic Progressive Party said that Ma Ying-jeou is a Mainlander. What exactly is this concept of "Mainlander", Professor Cheng?	2	6	13	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	218.367	229.899	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	In fact, the uh, ethnic concept in Taiwan, oh, uh, is somewhat created by political differentiation and intentional segregation.	2	7	14	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	229.899	246.287	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	However, it is undeniable that the concept of the so-called "Mainlanders" mainly refers to the fact that after 1949, well, the Kuomintang government led over one million uh, soldiers and civil servants to retreat to Taiwan.	2	7	15	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	246.287	254.194	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Well, at that time, this group of people came from everywhere. People from all corners of the country and every province were included.	2	7	16	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	254.194	270.539	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Then, besides this group of people, there were also hundreds of thousands of people who gradually moved to Taiwan starting probably ((pw)), before '49, probably in 1945, '46, and '47, probably after World War II.	2	7	17	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	270.539	277.835	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Just like my father, he came to Taiwan before uh, 1949. He first worked at the Salt Affairs Bureau.	2	7	18	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	277.835	295.978	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Well, take me as an +example. I am a typical so-called "second generation Mainlander". My father is a native of Fuzhou, Fujian. My mother is a native of Hefei, Anhui. Therefore, in the general concept, Taiwan society will call us pure Mainlanders and second generation Mainlanders.	2	7	19	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	295.978	312.165	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Nowadays, there are relatively few people in Taiwan whose parents are both Mainlanders. The number of people whose fathers are Mainland retired army personnel and veterans while their mothers are natives is rising. This is a very typical phenomenon.	2	7	20	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	312.165	318.338	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Of course, there are many whose fathers are natives who married uh, uh, uh, the daughters of Mainlanders.	2	7	21	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	318.338	322.931	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	The phenomenon of inter-marriage is becoming increasingly frequent especially after the second generation.	2	7	22	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	322.931	329.759	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Thus, it is indeed a bit difficult to separate Mainlanders from natives in Taiwan nowadays.	2	7	23	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	329.759	334.854	speaker#1	female	native	Then, Professor Cheng, can you give us some examples of Mainlanders who are currently active in Taiwan politics?	2	8	24	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	334.854	342.338	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Uh, for the so-called "Mainlanders" in Taiwan politics nowadays, oh, Ma Ying-jeou uh, is on the front line, the first and most evident example.	2	9	25	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	342.338	363.375	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Besides Ma Ying-jeou, many legislators including Lee Ching-an, Chiang Hsiao-yen, oh, uh, all these legislators, Lin Yu-fang, Lin Yu-fang is Hakka, also, also cannot be considered as so-called "natives". In addition, for instance, Yao Eng-chi, former uh, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, he is also Hakka. Nobody thinks that he is Minnan either.	2	9	26	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	363.375	376.813	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Well, now, Wang Jin-pyng, President Wang is an authentic so-called "Minnan" or "native". Therefore, uh in Taiwan, people can basically tell straight off between Mainlanders and natives, especially these famous people in politics.	2	9	27	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	376.813	391.345	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Then, when we compare James Soong and Lien Chan, James Soong is a genuine Mainlander while Lien Chan is what we called "Half-Tangshan people". Yet, in the eyes of the Democratic Progressive Party, Lien Chan is still a Mainlander. He is not native enough.	2	9	28	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	391.345	404.985	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Then, in Taiwan, in the past, these early power elites from Chiang Ching-kuo, Sun Yun-hsuan, and Yan Chia-kan, almost all these Kuomintang seniors were Mainlanders.	2	9	29	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	404.985	420.844	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	In addition, there is one more thing worth noticing, that is, in the early days, that is, about 10 years ago, almost all the generals of the Taiwanese army, the senior generals whom we saw in the Taiwanese army were so-called "Mainlanders".	2	9	30	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	420.844	440.479	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Then, probably in the past 10 years, the native uh, ethnic group, so-called "native ethnic group" have been gradually promoted to ((pw)) and senior uh, leadership positions. We see an increasing number of natives occupying Major General, Lieutenant General, and even a few General uh, positions in the army.	2	9	31	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	440.479	458.946	speaker#1	female	native	Professor Cheng, you said earlier that you are a pure Mainlander. Then, I want to ask Mr. Chang Chi-kai, based on the uh, differentiation criteria that Professor Cheng assigned earlier, are you a native or a Mainlander? In your daily uh, work or life, have you particularly noticed the difference between native and Mainlander?	2	10	32	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	458.946	476.158	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	Oh, my ancestors came to Taiwan from Fujian approximately 200 years ago, that was, during the Qing Dynasty. I am considered having the so-called "Mainlander" place of origin. If we consider my Mainlander place of origin, I am already the seventh generation. Therefore, they say that I am a very authentic Taiwanese, that is, the seventh generation Mainlander who came from Fujian. Now, I am called Taiwanese.	2	11	33	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	476.158	487.439	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	I grew up in the country in Chiayi, Taiwan myself. Why did I live in the country in Chiayi? At that time, under poverty-stricken situation, my ancestors crossed the so-called "Black Strait", which is the Taiwan Strait, to come to Taiwan to seek a living.	2	11	34	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	487.439	496.415	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	Well, the Chiayi, Yunlin, and Tainan regions were the most fertile places in Taiwan so they ((pw)), settled down in this place. They started farming and working. After that, they started to take roots in this place.	2	11	35	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	496.415	505.478	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	Children who grew up in the country like me, when I return to the country in Chiayi, the language I use to communicate with my family and my relatives is still the language you hear in Fujian.	2	11	36	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	505.478	530.173	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	I started reporting on political news in Taiwan 21 years ago in 1987. At that time, I reported on news of the Legislative Yuan in Taiwan, the so-called "political headlines". I had a deep impression at that time. When I went to the Legislative Yuan then, almost the entire over 200 legislators came from the Mainland at that time, only about a dozen were Taiwanese legislators elected through by-election in Taiwan, including ((pw)) those whom Mr. Cheng mentioned earlier.	2	11	37	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	530.173	552.105	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	All soldiers as long as their ranks were higher, for instance, above the Lieutenant Colonel level, may be above the so-called "Senior Colonel" level in the Mainland, they were almost all Mainlanders. However, this has gradually changed. ((pw)), for instance, in 1991, an overall +improvement started 16 years ago. Political power has been gradually handed over to the Taiwanese. Therefore, with the passing of more than a decade, the barrier is slowly becoming smaller and smaller.	2	11	38	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	552.105	572.232	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	However, under what circumstances do we in turn say that, uh, the cultural differences are still huge? An example would be, as I mentioned earlier, in the language, in the language used, especially among older people. For example, perhaps majority of the people over 60 years old in Taiwan may still speak Minnan now. This was why during the election, when Ma Yin-jeou went to deliver speeches at many occasions, you saw that he spoke Minnan in his speech.	2	11	39	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	572.232	582.645	speaker#1	female	native	We saw that Chen Shui-bian always boasted that he is the son of Taiwan, including when the Democratic Progressive Party came to power in 2000, he said that this represented the first time natives in Taiwan truly extricated themselves.	2	12	40	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	582.645	594.503	speaker#1	female	native	We see that many politicians in Taiwan such as Lee Teng-hui and Annette Lu, since they constantly claim that they are natives, we feel that they seem to be very proud. It seems that only natives have a true love for Taiwan.	2	12	41	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	594.503	601.674	speaker#1	female	native	Well, Professor Cheng, from where do you think the ancestors of people like Chen Shui-bian, Lee Teng-hui, and Annette Lu came?	2	12	42	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	601.674	629.539	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	In fact, uh, Lee Teng0hui, Annette Lu, Chen Shui-bian, and even senior members of the Democratic Progressive Party, whether it is Chang Chun-hsiung, Chang Chun-hung, or Hsu Hsin-liang and Shih Ming-the, who served as the Chairman of the uh, Democratic Progressive Party before, if you talk to everyone of them, they will all tell you, "My ancestors came from the Central Plains of the Mainland." They will never attempt to conceal the truth that their ancestors came from Mainland China.	2	13	43	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	629.539	649.018	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Well, the information that we read, for instance, Chen Shui-bian admitted himself that his historical ancestor who came to Taiwan was named Chen Wu. It was something that happened over 320 years ago. Well, up until today, his ancestral memorial tablet still writes that they came from Ci Yao Village in Zhao An County, Zhang Zhou, Fujian.	2	13	44	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	649.018	671.500	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	As for Annette Lu, she even went to Mainland China personally in 1990 to seek her root. She stood on uh, the land in Tian Zhong Village of Shuyang Township in Nanjing County, Zhang Zhou, Fujian and drank a mouthful of water from the ancient well. She said, "I need to drink a mouthful of well water from my hometown. This is what feeling grateful truly means."	2	13	45	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	671.500	691.422	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Annette Lu's brother frequently goes back to his hometown to pay tribute to his ancestors' tombs and offer sacrifices to his ancestors. More evidently, Mr. Lee Teng-hui is Fujianese. At times, Mr. Lee Teng-hui often tells Hakka ethnic group, "Actually, I, Lee Teng-hui is Minnan. I am also Hakka."	2	13	46	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	691.422	710.760	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	To put it bluntly, everyone came from the Central Plains. These people include Chen Shui-bian, the founder of the fundamental creed of Taiwan Independence. He had returned to Mainland China himself. He had visited Beijing. When he took a picture in front of the Tiananmen, he was also very excited.	2	13	47	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	710.760	721.619	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Well, of late, now because of elections and power struggle, these people have forgotten that they really should bear in mind where their happiness comes from.	2	13	48	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	721.619	729.727	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Taiwanese say that one should be grateful. Then, where is your origin? How can you dismiss it with a wave of the hand here and now?	2	13	49	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	729.727	743.022	speaker#1	female	native	Then, to say it this way, people who can actually be called true Taiwanese should be the Aborigines in Taiwan. We also read material saying that there are approximately 484,000 Aborigines in Taiwan nowadays, about 1.3 percent of the total population in Taiwan. It is a small proportion.	2	14	50	filler	statement

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	746.569	757.929	speaker#1	female	native	According to historical data, uh, the ancestors of the Aborigines in Taiwan also migrated from the southeastern coast of the Mainland to there a long time ago. What is your opinion on this argument, Professor Cheng?	2	14	52	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	757.929	773.461	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	There are oh, two arguments about the origin of the Aborigines in Taiwan. One maintains that they originated outside the island. Well, it maintains that they were uh, uh, uh, Austronesian peoples. Well, their place of origin was Austronesian.	2	15	53	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	773.461	805.562	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Another, however, there is another argument deduced from data in archaeological literature in language and Taiwan mythological legend. The place of origin of the Aborigines in Taiwan should be along the ((pw)), southeastern coast of Mainland China. Scholars even argued that the time the Aborigines moved to Taiwan, the time they arrived in Taiwan was around 3000 B.C. during the Xian Tao Era. Well, no matter which tribes these Aborigines in Taiwan belonged, some scholars argue that to put it bluntly, they all originated from the southeastern coast of Mainland China.	2	15	54	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	805.562	813.892	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Well, we have seen many famous Aborigines. For instance, Ko Yuan-chih is Amis, Yang Chuan-kwang, a former Olympic uh, athlete, is Amis.	2	15	55	filler	statement

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1075.841	1105.073	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	In fact, many people in Taiwan have been talking about the 2/28 uh, incident up until now. The 2/28 Incident was that when the Kuomintang government took over Taiwan, originally, it had high hopes in the Kuomingtang government because frankly speaking, at that time, Taiwan was an extremely poor place. However, later, because at that time, there was the so-called "War of Resistance against Japan", at that time, at that time, the Mainland was also deeply in war. Thus, when they first went down to uh, Taiwan, later, many Taiwanese who originally had many respect for them finally saw and said, "Why are we still so poor?" Their heart thus sank.	5	19	77	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1105.073	1119.902	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	Later, more seriously, the so-called "ethnic clash" happened, which was the so-called "2/28 Incident" in which Mainlanders killed natives and natives killed Mainlanders. This has become an extremely, extremely serious wound in Taiwan up until now. It is still not completely healed yet.	5	19	78	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1119.902	1136.384	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	A very important step in the harmony among ethnic groups in Taiwan started in Mr. Ching-kuo's old age. At that time, he started to advance the so-called, so-called "Tsui Tai-ching". The so-called "Tsui Tai-ching", in other words, even though Chiang Ching-kuo was a Mainlander who came from the Mainland, he had selected many, many native elites and promoted them to important positions, among which, of course, was the so-called "Mr. Lee Teng-hui".	5	19	79	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1136.384	1150.001	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	Then, many of them were Taiwanese elites. He gradually put them in many, many important positions. Thus, at that time, many Taiwanese felt that the Taiwanese could extricate themselves from miserable circumstances. Even though Chiang Ching-kuo and other people were ((pw)), were in power, the Mainlanders were in power, Taiwanese could, could slowly rise. The trend of the so-called "Tsui Tai-ching" gradually thrived.	5	19	80	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1150.001	1155.938	speaker#1	female	native	Then, Professor Cheng, why do uh, ethnic conflicts seem to be particularly acute whenever there is an election?	5	20	81	filler	statement

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1181.808	1200.043	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	For instance, Chi-kai is what people generally considered as native. I am what people always called a Mainlander. Yet, the first time I met Chi-kai, we were jubilant to meet each other and we had a very pleasant talk. Chi-kai autographed the book he wrote on the spot and gave it to me. When I returned, I told all my students, "Do you know that I became acquainted with Chang Chi-kai?"	5	21	84	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1200.043	1216.792	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	However, in my heart, I would not think that Chi-kai and I are of different races.

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1216.792	1230.404	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	On the contrary, we think that since we have common concerns for certain issues, since we share common values, it makes Chi-kai and I feel that we are together, that we stand on the same side, that we are a collective family.	5	21	86	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1230.404	1248.717	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Once election comes, uh, various political parties in Taiwan, especially the Democratic Progressive Party, it is very good at playing the so-called "native card". It continues to instill the belief in voters through long-term propaganda publications that to be native is to love Taiwan, it is to love the Democratic Progressive Party.	5	21	87	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1248.717	1270.376	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	In addition, there were indeed some inter-provincial misunderstanding and conflicts, especially when the Kuomintang regime first came to Taiwan. In the beginning during uh, uh, the 50's and the 60's, the prolonged control of the uh, distribution of power and resources in Taiwan by Mainland big wigs had made native elites in Taiwan felt wronged in their heart.	5	21	88	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1270.376	1290.460	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Then, native ethnic group in Taiwan, the Minnan ethnic group naturally hoped that in the election, Taiwanese, native Minnan candidate could win uh, in the election, so the phenomenon of ethnic voting would appear in the uh, votes. Thus, it led to the exploitation of the weakness by the Democratic Progressive Party.	5	21	89	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1290.460	1314.676	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	The result of their continuous operation made them believe that the native card had +scored one victory after another. Only until this time did they kick an iron plate. Why did they kick an iron plate? It was because of the change in the population structure in Taiwan. The change in the population structure in Taiwan and the change of generation, as well as the wave of globalization and of a flat world affecting the social, economical, and cultural aspects of Taiwan.	5	21	90	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1314.676	1340.977	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Therefore, we saw that majority of young voters in Taiwan, those who ranged from 20 to 29 years old, did not vote for Chen uh, the Democratic Progressive Party this time. What was the reason? It was because this entire young ethnic group is a generation born after 1980. What they encounter is shared living experience. It is difficult for them to identify with the so-called "hatred" of the 2/28 or let it stir up their emotions anymore.	5	21	91	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1340.977	1344.946	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	I believe that this group of young uh, university students are the hope of Taiwan's future.	5	21	92	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1344.946	1358.072	speaker#1	female	native	Therefore, in this case, ethnic conflict is indeed created by people. Well, let's look at this election again. Even though Mainlanders only accounted for around 13 percent of the total population in Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou won 58 percent of the votes in the end.	5	22	93	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1358.072	1364.055	speaker#1	female	native	There were commentaries analyzing that the ethnic card that the Democratic Progressive Party had been skilled at playing lost its effectiveness on Ma Ying-jeou this time.	5	22	94	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1364.055	1374.868	speaker#1	female	native	This implies that the Taiwan society is matured enough because it can accept a Mainlander who was not born in Taiwan but grew up there to be its leader. What is your opinion about such analysis?	5	22	95	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1374.868	1390.581	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	Yes, the ethnic card indeed had long been effective in past elections, especially in the general elections. An important factor was of course, the Minnan ethnic group is the majority in Taiwan while the Mainlanders only constituted 13 percent. Thus, it was effective because it was the majority against the minority.	5	23	96	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1390.581	1405.607	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	However, a popular remark in Taiwan nowadays is, "Are you tired?" Since it has been operating for so long, people are truly tired. It has happened too many times. People are tired of it. More importantly, people said the reason Ma Ying-jeou won this uh, election was the so-called "defeat of the ethnic issue by economic issue".	5	23	97	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1405.607	1417.077	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	Nowadays, what people in Taiwan concern more is not where you come from, whether you are Mainlander or native? It is not ethnic issue. It is the issue of livelihood. Is there any employment opportunity? Is your stomach full? Thus, the economy has defeated uh, the ethnic group.	5	23	98	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1417.077	1438.609	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	Thus, this time, many people believed that it was, it was naturally a, a very important watershed. Ma Ying-jeou, a second generation Mainlander, could get 58 percent of the votes. Obviously, not only the 13 percent of Mainlanders voted for him, majority of the natives also voted for him. Thus, he is a, a leader of the whole people. As a result, he should have such prominence. This magic spell was completely ripped open this time.	5	23	99	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1438.609	1447.093	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	More importantly, it was not only the ethnic magic spell being ripped open. The people became very clear.

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1447.093	1469.033	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	I want to use a, the last, to do a brief uh, summary. In fact, "Taiwan", the term "Taiwan" in Minnan language is "mai yuan", when it is converted into Mandarin, it is to bury the ghosts of those who were killed, to bury the ghosts of those who were killed. What is the reason? It is because in the past, many people from the Mainland, especially areas around Fujian, must cross the Taiwan Strait to live, to make a living in Taiwan due to poverty.	5	23	101	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1469.033	1482.018	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	However, do you know that in the early days, transport facilities were poor. Therefore, a couple of hundred years ago, many people who came from Fujian to Taiwan to live, to simply make a living because of the extreme poverty in ((pw)) their hometown died in the uh, Taiwan Strait. Thus, it is called bury the ghosts of those who were killed.	5	23	102	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1482.018	1489.971	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	The Mandarin of this Taiwan, Taiwanese language, uh Minnan language is to bury the ghosts of those who were killed. Thus, basically, it was a, a very tragic immigration history.	5	23	103	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1489.971	1499.284	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	However, those who stayed, just like my ancestor, he was very fortunate. He crossed the so-called "Black Water Strait", the Taiwan Strait. Up until now, it has been seven generations from his to my generation.

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1499.284	1512.797	Zhang_Qi_Kai	male	native	Well, people like Ma Ying-jeou came later. They are still called second generation Mainlanders now. Yet, basically, we all came from the Mainland. It is only a matter of arriving early or late. Well, through this election, more importantly, the people in Taiwan have gradually abandoned the uh, ethnic spell. What we want is income.	5	23	105	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1512.797	1525.419	speaker#1	female	native	We also saw analysis that an important task for Ma Ying-jeou after he won the election is to mend the ethnic rivalries in Taiwan caused by election battles and the resulting social rift.

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1525.419	1548.075	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	I believe uh, the historical burden of Ma Ying-jeou, exactly as he put it himself, the election certificate is only a thin piece of paper, yet, he feels a heavy burden weighing down on him. He even said that he cannot sleep in the middle of the night because he feels that he must lead the Taiwan society, not only economically, he must find the next spring for Taiwan.	5	25	107	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1548.075	1554.824	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	However, politically, in society, he must mend uh, ethnic segregation and ethnic conflicts created in the past.	5	25	108	filler	statement

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1566.777	1571.793	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	I think this was the first step that Ma Ying-jeou took. People should wait and see. They should give him some time.	5	25	110	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080407_073002	0	1571.793	1590.422	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Well, we also saw the personal charisma that Ma Ying-jeou displayed and the uh, warm welcome, encouragement, and support that the native people and villagers in the southern region extended to him when he went to the southern region.
