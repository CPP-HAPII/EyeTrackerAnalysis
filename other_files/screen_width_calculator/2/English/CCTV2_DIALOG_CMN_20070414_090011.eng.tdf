CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	369.496	378.591	speaker#2	male	native	As soon as the news came out, it drew the eager attention of the auto giants around the world. One after another they sent their strong bidding teams consisting of 50 to 100 people.	1	38	87	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	379.420	383.884	speaker#2	male	native	China's Nanjing Automobile Group also joined them and was determined to succeed.	1	38	89	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	383.884	399.073	speaker#2	male	native	If this bidding succeeded, +it would become the first case of overseas acquisition for Chinese corporations and would smoothly secure the high-level permit to enter the international auto market, thereby greatly enhancing NAC's strength and position in China's automobile competition lineup.	1	38	90	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	400.073	405.918	speaker#2	male	native	However, whether NAC had the strength to acquire the veteran British auto corporation gave rise to widespread doubts at that time.	1	38	93	report

CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	421.472	427.285	speaker#1	male	native	Other people all sent huge delegations of dozens of people to Britain; why did you only send a five-person delegation?	1	39	97	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	427.285	436.676	Wang_haoliang	male	native	On June 6, the high-level leadership group at NAC held a meeting and decided to participate in this worldwide international bidding.	1	40	98	report

CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	451.816	456.207	Wang_haoliang	male	native	They also submitted an introduction about the British company <foreign lang="English"> MG </foreign> MG Rover,	1	46	106	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	456.207	463.189	Wang_haoliang	male	native	and the information, data about some competing companies that might participate in the bidding at that time.	1	46	107	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	464.330	468.065	Wang_haoliang	male	native	So they thought that a team of powerful lineup must be sent.	1	46	109	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	468.065	477.143	Wang_haoliang	male	native	Participating in internal biddings at our NAC, we felt very clearly that the key was careful operation and determination to succeed.	1	46	110	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	477.143	477.658	speaker#1	male	native	Uh-huh.	1	47	113	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	479.281	490.452	Wang_haoliang	male	native	But the situation at that time, at that time, the British media's coverage of this issue, the extensive coverage was not very beneficial to us, NAC.	1	48	115	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	491.514	501.364	Wang_haoliang	male	native	They believed that NAC did not have the actual power, NAC did not have the strength to bid, believing that NAC was (()); some rather sharply described, rather sarcastically said that NAC was a swindler.	1	48	119	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	501.903	503.998	Wang_haoliang	male	native	So I thought we should not send a powerful lineup.	1	48	122	report

CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	504.513	511.153	Wang_haoliang	male	native	My actual strength did not necessarily have to be demonstrated in head-on confrontation; I called in the general manager.	1	50	124	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	511.153	524.263	Wang_haoliang	male	native	I said if we also sent twenty-six people, such a powerful lineup, on this mission, people may think you, NAC, are betting everything on a single bid.	1	50	125	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	525.700	532.653	Wang_haoliang	male	native	People may think that since that's the case, then everyone will bid high, reciprocating price raises and competing with one another.	1	50	129	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	533.231	541.376	Wang_haoliang	male	native	But in reality very few Chinese corporations participating in international biddings are experienced; all are doing it for the first time.	1	50	131	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	541.376	541.954	speaker#1	male	native	Uh-huh.	1	51	132	report	
CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	543.391	549.844	Wang_haoliang	male	native	So I believed that our strength did not have to be demonstrated by the sheer number of people.	1	52	134	report

CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	553.624	561.416	Wang_haoliang	male	native	I thought we should set out for the mission in a low key manner and show people our weakness.	1	54	138	report

CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	561.838	565.571	Wang_haoliang	male	native	Since everyone believed NAC was weak, uh, then I might as well be weak all the way.	1	56	140	report

CCTV2_DIALOG_CMN_20070414_090011	0	566.759	579.887	Wang_haoliang	male	native	First, uh, first, the British media reported at that time that setting out on the mission in a low key manner, there is little chance for NAC to succeed.	1	61	146	report
