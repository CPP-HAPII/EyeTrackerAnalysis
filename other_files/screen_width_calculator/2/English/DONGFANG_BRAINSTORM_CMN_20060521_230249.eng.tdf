DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	308.109	314.781	speaker#1	male	native	This, three presidents, tell us a bit, which do you feel is more relaxed, an MBA or an EMBA that's taught inside business schools?	3	17	44	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	314.781	316.910	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	Of course an MBA is more relaxed.	3	18	45	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	316.910	317.753	speaker#1	male	native	Why?	3	19	46	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	317.753	322.041	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	Because if it's an MBA it has a lot of basic knowledge that you can teach him.	3	20	47	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	322.041	324.260	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	And the basic knowledge is relatively a bit easier.	3	20	48	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	324.260	328.394	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	With an EMBA there are more things at that level of strategy that need to be discussed.	3	20	49	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	328.394	330.715	speaker#1	male	native	When you say easy, what you mean is that they will believe what you are saying.	3	21	50	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	330.715	332.766	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	Um, normally like this.	3	22	51	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	332.766	337.888	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	The crux is that an EMBA has one more difficulty; what's the difficulty? Well, it is that all those sitting below are all experts.	3	23	52	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	332.766	337.888	speaker#1	male	native	Uh-huh.	3	23	53	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	337.888	344.644	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	Among our EMBA students, many are presidents. For presidents, they themselves understand a lot about his, this industry.	3	23	54	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	337.888	344.644	speaker#1	male	native	Uh-huh, OK.	3	23	55	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	344.644	348.650	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	So if you want to teach him, then you need to know more than he does, so the degree of difficulty is very high.	3	23	56	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	344.644	348.650	speaker#1	male	native	Uh-huh.	3	23	57	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	348.650	360.680	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	Uh, if you don't have the right skills, then you cannot take the job, right?	3	23	58	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	348.650	360.680	speaker#1	male	native	For example, say you normally, this, start giving an EMBA lecture, isn't it that for example, many professors, this, leg will tremble, any of that kind of phenomena, um?	3	23	59	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	360.680	361.960	speaker#1	male	native	This, President Zhang.	3	24	60	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	361.960	370.301	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Um, actually that's not always the case, because normally what President Zhang said is true, but some courses it's possible that giving them to EMBA students is even easier.	3	25	61	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	370.301	379.409	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	For example, discussing strategy. Well, because many MBA students have no experience in strategy, so if you give them a talk on strategy then it's going to be relatively more difficult.	3	26	62	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	370.301	379.409	speaker#1	male	native	For example, uh-huh.	3	26	63	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	379.409	390.530	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	As for an EMBA student, because he himself is at a higher level, he has made many strategic decisions, so when you are talking to him about such knowledge it's very easy for him to, this, resonation, so uh, at that time the results could be better.	3	26	64	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	379.409	390.530	speaker#1	male	native	Right, right.	3	26	65	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	390.530	398.521	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Ah, so it's possible, my meaning is that, for two different course lecturing, for MBA and for EMBA, the degree of difficulty can sometimes be hard for an MBA, and sometimes it can be hard for an EMBA.	3	26	66	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	390.530	398.521	speaker#1	male	native		3	26	67	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	453.948	458.003	Wen_Wu	male	native	Because ((pw)), my viewpoint is that teaching an EMBA is simpler.	5	35	79	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	458.003	468.478	Wen_Wu	male	native	Why is teaching an EMBA simpler? He, we often take a company as an example, but the president of this company is sitting down there, then he, uh, if the teacher is smarter, then he just induces him to speak.	5	35	81	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	488.239	490.926	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	But like me, I know because I often communicate with teachers.	5	37	86	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	523.900	531.310	Jin_Wei	male	native	Because if you look at our EMBAs, each of us has a deeper level of know-how, a very keen perspective, therefore, uh, understands immediately with simple teaching.	5	39	91	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	539.782	549.738	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	It seems an MBA is a bit simpler. I feel, when I, I was younger I went to study for an MBA. I didn't understand anything. You listen and believe whatever the teacher said.	7	43	95	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	539.782	549.738	speaker#1	male	native	Why?	7	43	96	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	549.738	559.039	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	Maybe right, you wouldn't know if he said right, or said wrong, and then you'd be given, given a hope--After you finished studying you could then go serve as a president.	7	43	97	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	549.738	559.039	speaker#1	male	native	This agrees with what our Zhang, President Zhang's viewpoint, right, it's easy to deal with.	7	43	98	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	559.039	561.914	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	So uh, students always listen, they're very excited.	7	43	99	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	561.914	574.724	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	I am thinking that now I haven't studied for an EMBA. Now today after coming across that many problems, I think if I went to study for an EMBA, if I brought up all the management problems, now I come across every day, my whole head would ache. I am thinking, how could it be possible for that teacher not to have a headache?	7	43	101	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	561.914	574.724	speaker#1	male	native	Uh-huh.	7	43	102	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	575.880	590.740	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	Uh, a teacher, a teacher won't have headaches. However, a teacher can look at many more things. The problems you may bring up are the ones you, you've come across. The teacher needs to understand 10, 20 problems like the one that gave you a headache. So that in the end he won't have a headache one bit, his head just won't ache then.	7	45	104	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	575.880	590.740	speaker#1	male	native	For example, say you, you're judging a student.	7	45	105	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	590.740	593.921	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	But his problem is what then? Then spend a lot more time to prepare, to understand.	7	46	106	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	593.921	600.047	speaker#1	male	native	Ah, President Zhen, I'm going to test you on the spot. You raise a problem that gives you a headache; let us test you on the spot, for example.	7	47	107	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	600.047	606.156	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	For example, that, that, that employee, after we go public, many headhunting companies come and try to take our staff.	7	48	108	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	606.156	608.477	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	So in the end, do you increase their salary, or not increase it?	7	48	109	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	608.477	610.289	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	If you increase the pay, then your cost will go up.	7	48	110	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	610.289	615.789	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	If you don't raise the salary because you've already gone public, and well-known. Headhunting companies are focusing on you and come to recruit. So what do you do then?	7	48	111	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	615.789	623.239	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	In that case there are, are two measures. One measure is just for you, you to provide very good opportunities for your employee's career advancement.	7	49	112	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	623.239	632.365	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	Within the business, form a very good culture, then take your business and create a work environment that's just like a family. So this way it will be relatively easier to keep people.	7	49	113	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	632.365	643.478	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	What is the other method? You, you can ((pw)) provide company employees with a better, an intense mechanism, right, if they work well, then they should get a lot. This way you can also keep people.	7	49	114	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	643.478	647.457	speaker#1	male	native	We also ask this guest, President Zhang. What opinion do you, do you have for this problem?	7	50	115	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	647.457	650.929	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Uh, I feel that if some workers want to go, you should let them go.	7	51	116	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	650.929	657.112	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Because if you increase their pay too much it might make other people very unbalanced, right?	7	51	117	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	657.112	662.998	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	So you don't want to keep every single person. The business will only keep those who identify with its ideals.	7	51	118	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	662.998	667.583					8	52	119	nontrans	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	667.583	677.736	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	So I, I will tell you one thing, ah, teaching an EMBA and an MBA are 85% of the same things, only that 15% is different.	9	53	120	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	677.736	682.635	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Like when you're eating noodles, the noodles are the same, the condiments are different, so the flavor isn't the same.	9	53	121	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	682.635	688.026	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	So that's to say those who have the skill, and ability of that 15%, those are the best teachers.	9	53	122	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	688.026	689.573	speaker#1	male	native	This 15% is what then?	9	54	123	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	689.573	702.501	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Ah, it's precisely that you have a kind of feeling for many years, right, it's exactly the same knowledge, your angle is different, how you view it from a different angle.	9	55	124	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	689.573	702.501	speaker#1	male	native	It sounds exactly like this, like what you just said, that kind, right, is taking the knowledge cultivated over so many years, mastering those kinds of things, that's precisely the 15%.	9	55	125	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	702.501	709.282	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Right, more or less.	9	55	126	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	709.282	713.001	speaker#1	male	native	After all this time, it turns out President Zhang is selling himself, heh.	9	56	128	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	713.001	718.497	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	How to say, uh. That an MBA is a level 8 competitor; an EMBA is a level 10 competitor.	9	57	129	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	713.001	718.497	speaker#1	male	native	Ah, hmmm.	9	57	130	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	718.497	729.064	speaker#1	male	native	My current question is regarding, uh, by our, this kind of a, that is an EMBA, these kinds of teaching peculiarities are, where does all that money that we seize end up?	9	58	131	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	729.064	734.674	speaker#1	male	native	According to the view of our two guests, it should be very relaxed. Relaxed, then shouldn't need to cost that much money.	9	58	132	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	734.674	743.930	speaker#1	male	native	According to us, just now your viewpoints, they all can, that means, I should say, it seems like we all should pay them, because they themselves help us and being the teachers.	9	58	133	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	743.930	748.526	speaker#1	male	native	So why does it take so much more money for everyone than an MBA?	9	58	134	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	748.526	754.849	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Uh, I think it's naturally that the direct costs, uh, are very high.	9	59	135	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	754.849	760.178	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	The second reason, you, like you, what I just said about the cultivated knowledge, this cultivated knowledge requires a cost to accumulate.	9	59	136	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	760.178	764.397	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Just like we train a good teacher, that requires a certain number of years.	9	59	137	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	764.397	770.982	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Oh, so it-it.	9	60	138	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	764.397	770.982	speaker#1	male	native	So Wei, Wei Ying, aren't you like this? You normally don't give your cultivated knowledge to your Guanghua School of Management MBA students.	9	60	139	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	770.982	774.653	speaker#1	male	native	You only pass the special knowledge on to EMBAs because they're the group that pays more money.	9	60	141	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	774.653	786.341	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	No. I'm, I'm only saying that your, this knowledge that's accumulated can be likened to a good screening. They want to create knowledge, these people perhaps don't spend a majority of their time teaching, teaching our students, but they take part in a lot of research.	9	60	142	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	774.653	786.341	speaker#1	male	native	Uh-huh.	9	60	143	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	786.341	797.890	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Because they need to lecture on a good example case, they need to carry out research activities. They uh, need to study a lot of theories. Also, when we train a teacher, train an outstanding teacher, this cost is very great.	9	60	144	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	786.341	797.890	speaker#1	male	native	Right.	9	60	145	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	808.571	816.207	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	Then you, you want to, want to have them give up those good opportunities outside, and come to your school to give classes. Isn't this an opportunity cost?	9	62	149	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	816.207	822.036	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	The opportunity cost is high, so you need to have a market price, right? If you don't pay a high enough salary, then the teachers will all run off.	9	63	151	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	816.207	822.036	speaker#1	male	native	Right, correct.	9	63	152	filler

Uh, this, this EMBA, it's an end point of a product, there are many upstream production links, there is no way to charge these links, so we can only gradually transfer the fee we charge at the end point retrospectively.	9	63	153	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1446.457	1448.123	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Usually it's like that.	15	118	261	filler

Say you're tested on playing the piano, you pass the 8th level. Now if you don't go off and find a good teacher to teach you, you study on your own, you can practice a long time and you're still able to pass the 10th level.	15	120	268	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1479.393	1483.970	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	So uh, I believe that in a period of time, there's a difference between the 8th and 10th levels.	15	120	270	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1483.970	1484.942	speaker#1	male	native	So it's still necessary to go and study.	15	121	271	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1533.536	1538.711	speaker#22	male	native	Since the premise ah, is that I went on at the public's expense, my unit gave me money for studying for an EMBA.	15	128	279	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1538.711	1541.665	speaker#22	male	native	So from my personal perspective I feel it was really worth it.	15	128	280	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1541.665	1549.169	speaker#22	male	native	Because I studied a lot of knowledge, uh, the teachers lectured about a lot of knowledge, allowing, allowing me to bring my ability into play at my current leadership position.	15	129	281	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1571.867	1580.127	speaker#22	male	native	Now from a perspective of not being worth it, it's that I studied so much knowledge. For the time being I cannot use it at my business at all, so I'm at a bit of a loss.	17	132	286	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1586.505	1595.025	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Actually, I usually tell people they need to have patience when they work. Some of the knowledge can be applied immediately, some of it you have to wait before it can be applied.	17	134	289	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1595.025	1599.762	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	If you currently can't apply the knowledge immediately, that doesn't mean it will not be useful in the future, right?	17	134	290	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1599.762	1603.279	speaker#1	male	native	Ah, but this isn't for sure, you could also have hopes in the future, ah.	17	135	291	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1603.279	1616.180	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Ah, this is something I often emphasize with my ((pw)), uh, my students. You don't want to think, it's precisely that if today you're studying for an EMBA, it's not like you're studying how to fry food, that after you've finished studying you can go back and can fry. What you study is knowledge of nutrition, right?	17	136	292	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1616.180	1624.799	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Ah exactly, these kinds of things guide you later. Maybe you yourself feel it's not useful. In reality it's already useful, therefore when you're deeply thinking about a question it's most certainly different from before you went to study it.	17	136	293	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1624.799	1636.161	speaker#1	male	native	Uh, after hearing this student's statement, I came upon having an insight, assuming we, all of the EMBA students here, all of you throw away the vanity, the vanity is that "You see, I have studied for an EMBA, all around are bosses."	17	137	294	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1636.161	1640.458	speaker#1	male	native	To be more practical, then perhaps it's quite profitable if you directly go to study for an MBA.	17	137	295	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1640.458	1644.911	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	What we just talked about was exchange, it's best when people of similar levels exchange.	17	138	296	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1644.911	1655.589	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Uh, like if you're, you're playing chess, of course it's best when you're playing with someone nearly the same level, right? Say you're currently ranked ninth level, and you find someone of the first level to play, uh, of the second level to play. Then it won't be any good, right?	17	138	297	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1655.589	1670.057	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Uh, so that's why we encourage, that is why we separate these programs. That's to say, each program is actually like many of you who run an enterprise and those who produce goods, it must have a, uh, focus on different people, right? You can't place them together.	17	138	298	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1670.057	1674.422	speaker#1	male	native	After listening to our Professor Zhang Wei Ying with so much coaxed teaching, President Jin, you haven't been moved.	17	139	299	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1679.267	1687.972	Jin_Wei	male	native	What I feel now is that this EMBA, ah, in some degree its meaning has some, some sort of fashion trend.	17	142	302	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1687.972	1696.948	Jin_Wei	male	native	This kind of trend is like our golfing, currently from village head to, to, to county's head commissioner, uh, from section chief to department director, if you can't play golf then it's not ok.	17	142	303	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1696.948	1706.056	Jin_Wei	male	native	I once said I was a fervent supporter of EMBAs, and later came to a, today, a critic with an isolated ((pw)) viewpoint.	17	142	304	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1706.056	1714.354	Jin_Wei	male	native	I feel if an EMBA alienated like golf, that is was seen as very common with all the people, then our EMBAs are maybe not that valuable.	17	142	305	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1826.814	1839.421	speaker#23	male	native	Perhaps before we went to school, many would feel that studying in, in a class at Beijing University, and obtaining a golden sign of an EMBA was very, that's very glorious, so we went for this sign.	19	145	313	report

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1980.764	1983.748	speaker#1	male	native	Professor Zhang.	19	151	337	report	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1983.748	1988.537	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Uh, I think our two most important points; a style of thought and a sense of mission.	19	152	338	report	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1988.537	1989.396	speaker#1	male	native	Ok.	19	153	339	report	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1989.396	1992.720	speaker#1	male	native	Explain to us a bit about this style of thought.	19	153	340	report	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	1992.720	2002.561	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Uh, what Guanghua School of Management attempts to teach you is not, ((pw)) a way to resolve a concrete problem, but it's a way to think deeply about resolving the problem.	19	154	341	report	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2002.561	2005.307	speaker#1	male	native	It sounds like, uh, Guanghua School of Management is a bit like a college of philosophy.	19	155	342	report	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2005.307	2009.209	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	The more someone is on a higher level, the smarter someone is, then the more philosophical thought is required.	19	156	343	report

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2014.152	2023.953	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Uh, because uh, this manager on the lower level, he requires understanding of technical skills. At the higher level of ((pw)), uh, manager, then he requires understanding a way of thinking, right?	21	158	345	report	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2014.152	2023.953	speaker#1	male	native	Yes, right, uh-huh.	21	158	346	report	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2023.953	2033.948	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Uh, the second point is, I think, a sense of mission. Actually, uh, at Guanghua School of Management we looked at all our teachers and students that entered Peking University. It's a historical responsibility, not just a kind of honor.	21	159	347	report	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2033.948	2046.502	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Ah, I often ((pw)) tell my students, don't tell me how much money you made, tell me the difference between this uh, your profession, uh, having your business and not having your business. If there is no difference then you've lived in vain, right?	21	159	348	report

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2050.483	2052.217	speaker#1	male	native	Professor Zhang.	23	161	350	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2052.217	2057.978	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	Uh, this first point I think is roughly the same as everyone's, uh, we here, is to broaden the mind.	23	162	351	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2057.978	2061.248	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	Now this broadening the mind is to broaden the management mind, broaden the experience mind.	23	162	352	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2061.248	2068.003	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	The second point is in fact similar to what I, I previously brought up, that is, is, is to cultivate ability.	23	162	353	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2068.003	2075.700	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	One of his abilities is a kind of leadership ability. A kind of ability to lead a business forward, an ability that can push a business into the international markets.	23	162	354	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2075.700	2088.394	speaker#1	male	native	Uh, just now President Zhang said what's important is of a high degree, sense of mission, sense of responsibility, right? The ability you emphasized is similar to the skill President Zhang just talked about. It's not very acceptable.	23	163	355	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2088.394	2092.404	speaker#1	male	native	Could you explain the, uh, the difference?	23	163	356	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2092.404	2096.653	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	The difference is that uh, uh, the ability, I said, uh, leadership ability.	23	164	357	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2096.653	2102.951	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	We've always said what China's development is. China's development is for entrepreneurs to be able to participate and compete in the international markets.	23	164	358	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2102.951	2108.357	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	If you take this ability and look at it as an ability, then leadership ability is all on the inside.	23	164	359	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2108.357	2112.526	speaker#1	male	native	Uh, this, uh, Wei Ying, I, uh, this inside, uh, sum up with two questions, ha.	23	165	360	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2112.526	2125.182	speaker#1	male	native	The first one is, uh, this seems, uh, President Zhang Weijiong, their, uh, training in their school is more skill, like doing solid things, like the ability to start work. Yours, uh, thinking ability seems mostly utopian, this uh first one may not be right.	23	165	361	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2125.182	2134.381	speaker#1	male	native	The second one now, the second one I just, though you have a big sense of mission, you spent a lot of time just now saying whether an industry had you or not, that, uh, uh, President Zhang said this leadership ability is needed internationally.	23	165	362	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2134.381	2139.710	speaker#1	male	native	I feel as if the first one, the first one has this technical skill to it.	23	165	363	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2139.710	2154.150	speaker#1	male	native	The second one, this technical skill also seems to be more, more broader than your, this, uh, uh.	23	166	364	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2139.710	2154.150	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	No, it doesn't. If the Chinese market currently already is a worldwide competitive market, if there is no difference if you are part of, or not part of this industry, then it's not possible that your business is an internationalized one.	23	166	365	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2154.150	2162.063	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Another counterpoint is that if you can internationalize, if you want to become internationalized, you must have this sense of mission, you need to survive a long time, that you must have.	23	167	366	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2162.063	2174.522	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Ah, actually the majority of businesses cannot survive for more than 20 years, so uh, how are you going to make your business, uh, business survive a long time? Then uh, you should study the mission of Peking University.	23	167	367	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2174.522	2179.774	speaker#1	male	native	Heh, President Zhang you should study.	23	168	368	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2179.774	2185.666	speaker#1	male	native	Uh, now let's look at our, uh, business, what it says. Uh, President Zhen, please go first.	23	168	369	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2185.666	2191.573	speaker#1	male	native	Ah, first, you ((pw)), uh, chance for a vacation, what's the meaning?	23	169	370	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2185.666	2191.573	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	A chance for a vacation.	23	169	371	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2191.573	2197.866	speaker#1	male	native		23	169	372	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2191.573	2197.866	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	You, you all want to become a entrepreneurs. Actually being a business professional doesn't have any good points. Businesses may have longer and longer lives; you though will have a shorter and shorter one.	23	169	373	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2197.866	2206.126	speaker#1	male	native	True, true.	23	169	374	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2197.866	2206.126	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	The life of a business professional is actually very, look at that-uh-that when we talked about the lifespan of a business professional becoming shorter and shorter, there are also more and more deaths from overwork.	23	169	375	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2206.126	2216.083	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	So actually as a real business professional, it's not that we can't go on vacation. If you take me and throw me on some beach, I'm lying on the beach, but actually in my head I'm still thinking about business affairs.	23	170	376	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2216.083	2226.896	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	Say if you have a good, a, a, a, a, uh, two, three weeks -- that's not two, three years -- two, three weeks where you can study something, you can throw away something, or stop doing it, that's actually quite a good chance for a vacation.	23	170	377	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2226.896	2237.527	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	Uh, meeting friends, originally I wanted to write something like a white swan, something like a spotted deer. I, I actually think that, that making friends should be very important, in, in the commercial circle.	23	170	378	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2237.527	2246.377	Zhen_Shi_Hui	male	native	Uh, of course in those circumstances you definitely want to go for the most expensive EMBA, the most expensive EMBA. Inside it will be the most valuable friends.	23	170	379	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2246.377	2250.819	speaker#1	male	native	President Jin.	23	171	380	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2250.819	2256.187	Jin_Wei	male	native	The first is, you definitely want the latest paradigm. And also another is exchanges between cultures.	23	172	381	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2256.187	2267.858	Jin_Wei	male	native	I'd like to add a bit, China's business administrators are quite pitiful, often work around inside a business. You can hardly have other chances for so-called cross cultural exchange, that is, making friends.	23	172	382	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2267.858	2278.515	Jin_Wei	male	native	The most pitiful is that only by paying out hundreds of thousands for an EMBA can we go off and make friends and see the white swan, the spotted deer. I think this is a kind of sadness for us, China's entrepreneurs.	23	172	383	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2278.515	2282.223	speaker#1	male	native	Let's take a look at what Wen Wu wrote.	23	173	384	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2282.223	2287.012	Wen_Wu	male	native	Here I want to explain a bit on why we say "relaxed."	23	174	385	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2282.223	2287.012	speaker#1	male	native	OK.	23	174	386	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2287.012	2292.517	Wen_Wu	male	native	First I'd like to say that the level, level of these students is higher, but with these students, uh, it's much easier for them to accept things.	23	174	387	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2287.012	2292.517	speaker#1	male	native		23	174	388	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2292.517	2299.522	Wen_Wu	male	native	You, you ask if the circle is important or not. Maybe when dealing with leaders it's more important, when dealing with the government it's very exhausting, dealing with classmates it's more relaxed.	23	174	389	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2292.517	2299.522	speaker#1	male	native	Uh-huh.	23	174	390	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2299.522	2309.539	Wen_Wu	male	native	Uh, another thing is that our teachers sometimes, when teaching some courses, they all teach you to do things that keep their value, do some things that avoid risk rather than saying exchange some extreme speculation.	23	174	391	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2299.522	2309.539	speaker#1	male	native		23	174	392	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2309.539	2318.735	Wen_Wu	male	native	Extreme speculation is very tiring. Also if the risk is high then the teacher will tell you, if you do things that keep their values, and do some secure, relatively secure business, this will then allow you to be more relaxed.	23	174	393	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2309.539	2318.735	speaker#1	male	native	Uh-huh.	23	174	394	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2318.735	2326.532	Wen_Wu	male	native	So my viewpoint is that after studying the entire EMBA, uh, it allows us businessmen in China, after finishing the study, he will be even more relaxed.	23	174	395	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2318.735	2326.532	speaker#1	male	native		23	174	396	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2326.532	2335.207	Wen_Wu	male	native	Just like, uh, Professor Zhang Weiying said about, uh, youth, what's that called, uh, youthful radiance, uh, even more confident to meet the next challenge.	23	174	397	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2326.532	2335.207	speaker#1	male	native	Right.	23	174	398	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2335.207	2336.035	speaker#1	male	native	Thank you.	23	175	399	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2336.035	2343.567	speaker#1	male	native	Standing from your angle, and after you've looked at what they wrote down, do you feel that, our, nowadays ((pw)) can satisfy their needs?	23	175	400	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2343.567	2353.138	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Should be able to, uh, but from the point we design this program, we don't do it for the students to have light learning, and it's also not just for students to make friends.	23	176	401	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2343.567	2353.138	speaker#1	male	native	Uh-huh.	23	176	402	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2353.138	2356.115	speaker#1	male	native	It sounds to me a little like it's to let them not have light work.	23	176	404	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2356.115	2368.231	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	We, we want them to work harder, but to be happy while working.	23	176	405	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2356.115	2368.231	speaker#1	male	native	Ah, so when you enter Peking University, you want to have that sense of mission, have that...	23	176	406	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2368.231	2378.183	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	Uh, you should say that after entering you'll meet lots of classmates. Then later this accomplishes a relaxed uh, uh, uh, period of time, and that also may be considered.	23	177	407	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2378.183	2385.864	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	Because these entrepreneurs normally are all very, very busy inside the businesses, so they come, they learn many new ways of thinking from teachers.	23	177	408	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2385.864	2390.807	speaker#1	male	native	What you said is really right. Today, that President Zhen came to us to take part in the program, in the afternoon after he came, he was working hard checking documents, checking documents all the time.	23	178	409	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2390.807	2398.565	Zhang_Wei_Jiong	male	native	It is this that solves many problems of thinking, taking all that's accumulated in his head, and as soon as he casts off the worries from continuously thinking about problems, then all of a sudden he'll be relaxed.	23	179	410	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2398.565	2411.606	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	I have another one, sorry, I want to add one more, ha. We, we had one EMBA student. After he finished studying, two years later he told me, I asked him what was the biggest reward. He said, "After I finished the EMBA, work became relaxed."	23	180	411	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2411.606	2418.547	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	I ask why, "I know how to let other people do work for me, originally I did everything." Now this, this is also one kind...	23	180	412	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2418.547	2420.063	speaker#1	male	native	Found the path, path to free oneself.	23	181	413	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2420.063	2425.315	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	Right, his ability of how to make use of other people's ability, this is precisely the most important skill in leadership.	23	182	414	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2491.682	2497.564	Jin_Wei	male	native	I feel cross cultural social interactions are very important, so of course if you don't have any other chance then you can only go to an EMBA class.	23	190	426	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2575.773	2585.652	speaker#4	female	native	I should say that some of the classmates, according to what I know, have already turned into business partnerships, collaborative partnerships, already, already have created a few companies together.	25	196	438	report

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2614.155	2621.414	speaker#6	male	native	Actually, uh, studying between the classmates can be more important, this is an interaction, when the teacher is teaching, actually the teacher is also learning from us.	25	201	444	report	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2621.414	2635.392	speaker#1	male	native	Once I ran into a president of this certain business school last year, and this president talked with me.

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2635.392	2639.132	speaker#1	male	native	This I didn't know, this sounds a bit like uh, boasting. How is that overall, high or low?	26	202	446	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2653.099	2669.631	speaker#25	female	native	From the classmates there I learned how to ((pw)) mold ((pw)) myself. Originally I was not, not a person who pays attention to image. Later from the classmates there I, uh, felt everyone is very well-behaved, very, very beautiful, very pretty. I think this also should be part of a person.	26	203	448	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2653.099	2669.631	speaker#1	male	native	Yes, right.	26	203	449	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2669.631	2677.235	speaker#25	female	native	So I also think one should learn from them.	26	203	450	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2677.235	2680.713	speaker#25	female	native	In normal times, I just didn't care about these things. In normal times I didn't care too much.	26	203	452	filler

DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2680.713	2700.108	speaker#25	female	native	Another thing that I also learned from studying at Peking University, just now Teacher Zhang, Teacher Zhang Weiying talked about, that is, that is mastering how to relax yourself, making use of other people's brains to make yourself relaxed. Formerly I was always tired, tired every day, ah, that's right.	26	203	454	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2680.713	2700.108	speaker#1	male	native	Right, now you don't work.	26	203	455	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2700.108	2705.605	speaker#1	male	native	OK, now that we've listened to them presenting this relation circle, has it had any effect on you two?	26	204	456	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2705.605	2709.371	Jin_Wei	male	native	For me, no effect.	26	205	457	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2709.371	2718.719	Jin_Wei	male	native	Uh, I think it's precisely like this. During the initial period of reform and opening up, this circle of relations was very important in the process of business development.	26	206	458	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2709.371	2718.719	speaker#1	male	native	Uh-huh.	26	206	459	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2718.719	2729.708	Jin_Wei	male	native	Look at spirits in China: during the first part of the reform and opening up period it sold especially well. Why's that? We weren't familiar with each other yet, at the table after drinking three shots of spirits then we're like big brothers, fraternal brothers that quickly became closely related.	26	206	460	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2718.719	2729.708	speaker#1	male	native		26	206	461	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2729.708	2733.704	Jin_Wei	male	native	Of course after being together morning and night for two years, that relationship was definitely solid as iron.	26	206	462	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2729.708	2733.704	speaker#1	male	native	Right.	26	206	463	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2733.704	2747.709	Jin_Wei	male	native	But now currently, 25 years after the reform and opening up, it's mainly to rely on those management ideals for business, rely on the business to have a correct, uh, accurate, correct judgment and decision making, relations have very little use in it.	26	206	464	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2733.704	2747.709	speaker#1	male	native	Uh-huh.	26	206	465	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2747.709	2766.720	Jin_Wei	male	native	Think about it. Suppose Zhang Ruimin, ah, Liu Chuanzhi are here in our MB, EMBA class today. Can his sales increase thirty percent because of his relationships? I don't think the chance is that big, ah.	26	206	466	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2747.709	2766.720	speaker#1	male	native	But, but we can increase that by thirty percent with the people he knows, with his classmates, they can introduce him.	26	206	467	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2766.720	2784.774	Jin_Wei	male	native	This possibility is not that big either, because in the world economy there is this fundamental development rule. In addition to all the other professions, all types of livelihood products are turning in the direction towards these common consumer products. Industries like this on the whole, it and relationship marketing, ah, relations are becoming less and less close.	26	207	468	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2784.774	2789.118	Jin_Wei	male	native	So then this circle's usefulness is becoming smaller and smaller.	26	207	469	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2789.118	2794.370	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	He's, uh, this viewpoint of making friends is just dogmatic pragmatism. This isn't good.	26	208	470	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2794.370	2802.861	speaker#1	male	native	That's too strong. You look, look at what I said, it's right. If you don't think it's worth it then you're not considered excellent, ah.	26	209	471	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2802.861	2809.091	speaker#1	male	native	This, this seems, you see, I think everyone who runs into you, first and foremost definitely won't have a lot of respect for you.	26	210	472	filler	
DONGFANG_BRAINSTORM_CMN_20060521_230249	0	2802.861	2809.091	Zhang_Wei_Ying	male	native	No, no, I and, I and my classmates are all friends.	26	210	473	filler
