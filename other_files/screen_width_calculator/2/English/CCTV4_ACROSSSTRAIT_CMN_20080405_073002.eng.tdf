CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	195.834	205.689	Li_Hong	female	native	And number two, um, is that the location, uh, was not at Chen Shui-bian's office. Rather, it was at the Taipei Guesthouse, and this meeting, um, was at the initiative of Chen Shui-bian inviting Ma Ying-jeou to meet.	3	8	19	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	205.689	210.213	Li_Hong	female	native	And, public commentary has jokingly said that, when you put Bian and Ma together, you get the character of "to cheat."	3	8	20	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	210.213	213.400	Li_Hong	female	native	Regarding these interesting details, have you noticed?	3	8	21	filler	question
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	213.400	223.025	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	This about taking Chen Shui-bian and Ma Ying-jeou's Ma, uh, adding this Bian to the Ma and it's the character of "to cheat,", this is already an old joke in Taiwan.	3	9	22	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	223.025	233.385	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	Then, from the relationship between Ma Ying-jeou and Chen Shui-bian, it's very unique. On a political level we often joke that Chen Shui-bian, um, is a dear person in Ma Ying-jeou's life.	3	9	23	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	233.385	246.451	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	At that time, uh, Ma Ying-jeou, um, defeated the incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian and pulled down the coveted Taipei mayoral seat.

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	246.451	269.575	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	And then, as no one expected, in two thousand and eight, um, again because Chen Shui-bian really messed things up through these eight years, Ma Ying-jeou, um, again defeated the governing Democratic Progressive Party. Then, he will very soon receive this leadership status from Chen Shui-bian's hand again! So, this Ma and Bian, these two, have a very interesting relationship from a political perspective, ah.	3	9	25	filler	statement

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	290.283	293.987	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	These two men's fate, political fate is very interesting. This is the first thing.	3	9	27	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	293.987	299.581	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	The second thing, um, that they should choose April 1, April Fool's Day, in reality it's actually a total coincidence.	3	9	28	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	299.581	305.455	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	Chen Shui-bian has emphasized repeatedly, this this invitation to meet with Ma Ying-jeou was at his initiative.	3	9	29	filler	statement

So he thought this time, he also had this type of high level as a leader, he should also take the initiative to invite Ma Ying-jeou for a meeting.	3	9	30	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	320.222	329.863	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	Why on April 1? Because it was not until just the day before, which was March 31, that Ma Ying-jeou received the election certificate.	3	9	31	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	329.863	356.065	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	In the complete electoral process in Taiwan, after your election has concluded, Taiwan's election committee will issue you an election certificate. Once you take this certificate, you are a qualified electee. So, Chen Shui-bian said, once Ma Ying-jeou has received the election certificate, I will get in touch with Ma Ying-jeou's side without delay. Because Ma Ying-jeou's schedule was very full, the two sides picked back and forth, and in the end picked April 1, which is April Fool's Day.	3	9	32	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	356.065	359.706	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	In connection with this issue, um, the two of them have made a lot of jokes.	3	9	33	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	359.706	374.363	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	Chen Shui-bian said that you, this, um, so-called April Fool's Day is, um, meant to make the wise appear foolish. So, um, make the wise appear foolish is putting it nicely. Then this, this day's, um, discussions between the two men, there are actually a lot of areas, um, that are really quite self-amusing and amusing to people.	3	9	34	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	374.363	387.346	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	Then why isn't it in Chen Shui-bian's office? Chen Shui-bian said that, because Ma Ying-jeou still isn't the official leader, uh, there was no need for the two to meet in his office. It's more natural to choose a location such as this one in which to meet.	3	9	35	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	387.346	393.455	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	So, there will be these little articles to write about the selections regarding both time and place.	3	9	36	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	393.455	413.891	Li_Hong	female	native	Then, regarding this meeting between Ma Ying-jeou and Chen Shui-bian, uh, the Nationalist Party side as well as Taiwanese public opinion have been very cautious in the lead-up, even to the point that some people in the media on the island suggested that Ma Ying-jeou should take a tape recorder when meeting with Chen Shui-bian. Others suggested, um, that in addition to taking the tape recorder, Ma Ying-jeou should also make a written record and have Chen Shui-bian sign it, and only then would it be ensured.	3	10	37	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	413.891	418.545	Li_Hong	female	native	Then, why would the Nationalist Party and Taiwanese public opinion be so worried about the Bian-Ma meeting?	3	10	38	filler	question
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	418.545	420.311	Li_Hong	female	native	I'd like to ask Professor Jiang.	3	10	39	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	420.311	428.967	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	Actually, Naijing also knows, the reason that they are so cautious about this Bian-Ma meeting, Naijing and I both know, is ((pw)), basically not because they don't trust Ma Ying-jeou. It's because they, uh, don't trust A-Bian.	3	11	40	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	428.967	434.249	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	Chen Shui-bian had several records in the past that basically caused a lot of damage to the people who met him.	3	11	41	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	434.249	435.529	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	The first, of course, was Lien Chan.	3	12	42	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	434.249	435.529	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	He was with --	3	12	43	filler	incomplete
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	435.529	440.560	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	Right, meeting with Chen Shui-bian was a Hongmen banquet. The meeting was bad, and the banquet was bad.	3	13	44	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	435.529	440.560	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	The Hongmen banquet, was not a good banquet.	3	13	45	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	440.560	443.840	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	It feels like preparing to lose, lose, lose the head on top your neck at any time.	3	14	46	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	443.840	457.050	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	The first, the first time, of course the most famous was the October 27, two thousand Bian-Lien meeting, when Chen Shui-bian met with Mr. Lien Chan. At that time, Mr. Lien Chan proposed relevant Nationalist Party financial policies with very good will, and Chen Shui-bian also very politely asked for advice.	3	14	47	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	457.050	473.168	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	However, during the course of their meeting, Mr. Lien originally worked in this, ah, this leader's office in the position of vice-leader, working in cooperation with Lee Teng-hui, so he was very familiar with the place. He knew that if there was a meeting, it would be on the third floor, and that there should be an elevator to take. But, when Mr. Lien arrived at the scene, the elevator was broken, forcing him to walk.	3	14	48	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	473.168	486.606	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	You could also say that, A-Bian would make you very embarrassed in a lot of little things. Originally, it was a place with which Mr. Lien was very familiar. Once he arrived at the scene, ah, how could the elevator be broken, malfunctioning, being repaired, so that he had to slowly walk up. Of course, Chen Shui-bian was upstairs at his leisure. This was the first time.	3	14	49	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	486.606	501.247	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	On October 27 at 12 noon, when Mr. Lien said goodbye to Chen Shui-bian, after he left ((pw)), the leader's office, Chen Shui-bian appointee Chang Chun-hsiung, the top official in the executive branch, immediately announced the cessation of construction on the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant.	3	14	50	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	501.247	519.826	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	During the course of the October 27 meeting between Chen Shui-bian and Lien Chan, he was basically respectful regarding the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant issue and whether or not to stop construction. He said they should seek further consultation and more opinions, but less than 5 minutes after the very moment that Lien Chan left the office and said goodbye to Chen Shui-bian, inside of another office, Chang Chun-hsiung announced the cessation of construction on the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant.	3	14	51	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	519.826	538.966	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	The newspapers said that this was Chen Shui-bian giving Lien Chan the biggest political slap, and after this, Taiwan's stock market began a tragic crash of enormous proportions and fell to unprecedented lows, to just over 2000 points. Countless Taiwanese stock investors were truly suffering. This was the first major damage that he caused.	3	14	52	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	538.966	552.500	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	The second was in two thousand five, even more important, and it came again. +May 24 two thousand five was the Bian-Soong meeting. What was even more ironic at that time was that in the background of the meeting between the two men, Chen Shui-bian and James Soong, was a picture of two characters for "sincerity," which a calligrapher had written.	3	14	53	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	552.500	568.826	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	Those two characters represented that the two men were going to meet with the utmost openness. In the end, after the two men had said goodbye, Chen Shui-bian began to tear down the bridges, began making public comments about asking for an official position, who James Soong had met with, etcetera, and all this began coming out again. He took the contents of the meeting with James Soong and privately released to reporters.	3	14	54	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	568.826	573.123	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	So, this time, of course, everyone would be very worried about whether Chen Shui-bian would pull out his old tricks.	3	14	55	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	573.123	596.737	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	Basically, the Nationalist Party's personality and Chen Shui-bian's personality, these people really are not the same. For these skilled officials of the Nationalist Party, whether it's Lien Chan, James Soong, or Ma Ying-jeou, they all have a basic discipline. That is to say, there are things they will do and things they will not do. But, with regard to Chen Shui-bian, there's no sky above and no earth beneath. Uh, there is no, no, no, no boundary between heaven and earth, so for him, it's not there are things he will not do. For him, there's nothing he won't do and nothing he won't say, so they are all very cautious.	3	14	56	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	596.737	605.950	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	On April 1, two thousand and eight, the two men met, actually with their status reversed. Chen Shui-bian tried to ride along with Ma Ying-jeou, but in reality he didn't succeed.	3	14	57	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	605.950	614.999	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	That is to say, if you put two flowers together, and one is tomorrow's flower, and the other is yesterday's yellow flower, the two are both flowers, but it's really obvious, there is a big difference in the value of the flowers.	3	14	58	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	614.999	638.281	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	Then this attempt of Chen Shui-bian to ride along, we generally conclude that it basically was successful. That is to say, ah, if your past record is not good, this desire to reap some small advantage or mooch some bit of gain, even to ask Ma Ying-jeou to make some concessions regarding policies, including the likes of the 1992 Consensus. Chen Shui-bian and Ma Ying-jeou had a very intense debate, one says there was, the other says there wasn't. It seems, then, that actually Taiwan's people have made a choice with 7.2 million votes.	3	14	59	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	638.281	657.784	Li_Hong	female	native	There is a very interesting character named Steve Chan in this Bian-Ma meeting. At the time of the 319 Shooting Incident in 2004, he was the head of the Chi Mei Hospital in Tainan. At that time, um, he was responsible for treating Chen Shui-bian's gunshot wound, but his actions attracted significant controversy. The blue camp thought that he was covering up the truth about Chen Shui-bian's gunshot wound.	3	15	60	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	657.784	663.643	Li_Hong	female	native	And in the 2008 elections, he joined Ma Ying-jeou's camp and became a central figure among Ma's top aides.	3	15	61	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	663.643	669.409	Li_Hong	female	native	Then, how should we view his transition from green to blue? Can you give us a brief introduction to this person Steve Chan?	3	15	62	filler	question
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	669.409	687.190	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	Uh, to speak more precisely, ah, this Steve Chan, um, you shouldn't say that he was transformed from green to blue because when Vincent Siew served as the top official in the executive branch, he was recruited by Siew to serve as the head of the Department of Health. So he has acted as an official within this Nationalist Party system.	3	16	63	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	687.190	698.505	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	Nonetheless, you can't really say that Steve Chan was transformed from blue to green either, ah, because he, speaking from a political personality standpoint, I think he is pretty close to between light blue and light green.	3	16	64	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	698.505	729.052	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	What I mean is, um, let's take a look, ah, Steve Chan is from a family of doctors from Tainan, um, Changhua county of Taiwan. Five generations of their family, um, were all doctors. His daughter is also a doctor.

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1400.077	1414.205	Li_Hong	female	native	Uh, this former legislator of Democratic Progressive Party, Shen Fu-hsiung, ah, heavily praised Tuan Yi-kang, but the Democratic Progressive Party's party general convener Ker Chien-ming did not agree, saying that these people criticizing Chen Shui-bian after a major election are pouring salt on the Democratic Progressive Party's wounds.	15	34	137	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1414.205	1418.096	Li_Hong	female	native	Then, Professor Jiang, how do you view the varying attitudes towards Chen Shui-bian within the Democratic Progressive Party?	15	34	138	filler	question
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1418.096	1434.686	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	If the Democratic Progressive Party's criticism of Chen Shui-bian had come before the election, Naijing, that's called ((pw)), "a heroic man severing his arm." After losing the election, then to go back and criticize Chen Shui-bian, this is called "severing the tail to be alive." Both are severing, but the severing is not the same. Before the election it's "a heroic man severing his arm" because it indeed was a burden, and caused damage to the Democratic Progressive Party. After the election, ah, you have to "sever the tail to be alive."	15	35	139	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1434.686	1456.467	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	Of course, for people holding powers, for the current Democratic Progressive Party, they still hope that Chen Shui-bian can provide them with some administrative resources in his final forty days. So, look, like Ker Chien-ming, +its general convener of the Legislative Yuan, Ker Chien-ming said that this was equivalent to sprinkling salt on the Democratic Progressive Party's wounds. No. He's definitely not sprinkling salt, he's sprinkling iodine. If you don't add iodine, if you don't use hydrogen peroxide to wash it clean, it will get inflamed.	15	35	140	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1456.467	1458.545	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	So the self criticism at this time is already too late.	15	35	141	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1458.545	1464.717	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	Of course Chen Shui-bian of course he needs to bear the greatest responsibility, because power and responsibility are two halves of the same body. Power and responsibility have to be compatible.	15	35	142	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1464.717	1480.575	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	Since this is a no-confidence referendum on Chen Shui-bian, regarding his controlling of ethnic groups to split the two sides of the strait and to split the core values of domestic Taiwan for the last eight years, if you do an overall self-criticism about these, the Taiwanese people have already used their votes to prove that Chen Shui-bian's ruling was indeed a failed ruling.	15	35	143	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1480.575	1488.622	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	Then under this situation, the Democratic Progressive Party of course needs to self-criticize themselves. If they don't solve from the most fundamental problems, how can they make the Democratic Progressive Party rise again from the ashes?	15	35	144	filler	question
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1488.622	1501.806	Jiang_Min_Qin	male	native	So, this is already not "a heroic man severing his arm." We, we especially emphasize that it is "severing the tail to be alive." After you "sever the tail," you definitely have to apply iodine. Iodine will hurt, but only diminishing the inflammation, only stopping the pain, only disinfecting will the Democratic Progressive Party be able to heal.	15	35	145	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1501.806	1518.092	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	Let's look at this Tuan Yi-kang. He is the general convener of the New Tide Faction, ah, then what he represents is a new tide of strength within the Democratic Progressive Party. Today, um, he came out and said that he wanted to criticize Chen Shui-bian, pointing the tip of the spear at Chen Shui-bian, is actually the beginning of a new cycle of struggles.	15	36	146	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1518.092	1531.589	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	Why is it that after Tuan Yi-kang and others issued this type of criticism within the Democratic Progressive Party, it also attracted counter attacks from other various personnel within the party? Because we know that that during these eight years of the Democratic Progressive Party's ruling, the New Tide Faction, um, enjoyed all advantages.	15	36	147	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1531.589	1535.901	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	The New Tide Faction, in every struggle within the Democratic Progressive Party, they are always the first to make a move.	15	36	148	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1535.901	1545.527	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	They make the first strike against others with different ideological standpoints, and then rush to compromise and choose, with someone who has the best opportunity to grab power.	15	36	149	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1545.527	1551.869	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	So, during the eight years of the Chen Shui-bian period, the seats that the New Tide Faction possess did not decrease at all.	15	36	150	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1551.869	1560.334	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	But, why would the New Tide Faction take the first shot at Chen Shui-bian? This has always been the struggle character of the New Tide Faction, because attacking Chen Shui-bian is the easiest.	15	36	151	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1560.334	1579.725	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	On May 20, Chen Shui-bian is going to step down. He still will be wrapped up in the future lawsuit. If they don't beat Chen Shui-bian's remaining power away within the Democratic Progressive Party right now, then these people won't be able to genuinely enter the post-Bian era and launch a new wave of contention for power. So, these are these people's calculations.	15	36	152	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20080405_073002	0	1579.725	1603.693	Yin_Nai_Jing	female	native	And in the end, the so-called voices of the New Tide Faction that represent the new generation, can they thoroughly beat down the People Progressive Party's Formosa Generation, and the Democratic Progressive Party's Defense Lawyers Generation, that is people like Frank Hsieh, Chen Shui-bian, Su Tseng-chang, and genuinely be able to bring the new generation to be leaders and decision makers? As of now, I don't have a very optimistic view of the situation.	15	36	153	filler	statement
