PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	795.829	798.697	Shi_qiping	male	native	because of the, uh, one-child policy in mainland China.	9	34	189	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	798.697	804.315	Shi_qiping	male	native	And the third is perhaps more important: that is obtaining the rights of a Hong Kong -- a Hong Kong resident when it's born.	9	34	190	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	804.846	809.873	Shi_qiping	male	native	Uh, so under these kinds of conditions, looking at it from the perspective of the general public in Hong Kong,	9	34	192	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	809.873	816.412	Shi_qiping	male	native	what they're rather worried about it, uh, if this number reaches a certain level, then Hong Kong's medical resources will be stretched too thin.	9	34	193	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	816.412	821.580	Shi_qiping	male	native	And we all know, this is a, uh, uh, resource, ah, that belongs to the Hong Kong taxpayers.	9	34	194	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	821.580	831.493	Shi_qiping	male	native	So, the second thing they're rather worried about is, uh, some of these pregnant women from the mainland have not been able to do enough of these health -- uh, prenatal examinations.	9	34	195	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	831.493	841.717	Shi_qiping	male	native	Uh, therefore the children they give birth to may sometimes have many, uh, problems with their physical health. So this also increases the burden on Hong Kong's medical systems.	9	34	196	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	841.717	846.855	Shi_qiping	male	native	And in the longer term, that is, uh -- a problem with the birth rate in the Hong Kong population.	9	34	197	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	846.855	850.951	Shi_qiping	male	native	Actually, about this third problem -- to Hong Kong, it's one that has both pros and cons.	9	34	198	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	850.951	856.068	Shi_qiping	male	native	Because we all know that in the last few years in Hong Kong, uh, another problematic issue is that the birthrate is too low.	9	34	199	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	856.068	861.095	Shi_qiping	male	native	So in fact, looking at it from this angle, if the mainland can provide more children for Hong Kong,	9	34	200	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	861.095	865.791	Shi_qiping	male	native	then this should be a positive thing for, uh, the future age structure of Hong Kong's population.	9	34	201	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	865.791	869.626	Shi_qiping	male	native	No matter what, this issue has certainly generated great waves of controversy and disturbance in Hong Kong.	9	34	202	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	870.168	877.228	Shi_qiping	male	native	Uh, I believe that, uh, in future it will also become a very important controversial topic in politics.	9	34	204	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	877.228	883.627	Shi_qiping	male	native	Uh, we all know that in the near future Hong Kong will elect its chief executive. Uh, Donald Tsang will be contesting the election to continue in office.	9	34	205	report

PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	892.510	901.915	Shi_qiping	male	native	So, then under the previous government, uh, in that time we can see that the, uh, SAR government should have had fairly in-depth talks with the central government on this issue.	9	34	207	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	901.915	904.769	Shi_qiping	male	native	So the plan presented today, uh,	9	34	208	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	905.389	914.662	Shi_qiping	male	native	in terms of operations, should make for an increase in the cost or the difficulty for pregnant women from the mainland coming to Hong Kong to give birth.	9	34	210	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	914.662	923.313	Shi_qiping	male	native	But just as many of the, uh, members of the public just interviewed said, uh, perhaps it won't necessarily be able to fundamentally -- won't be able to fundamentally solve this problem.	9	34	211	report	
PHOENIX_ASIANJRNL_CMN_20070116_075800	0	923.313	930.674	Shi_qiping	male	native	So I think this kind of policy right now is basically a temporary -- or to put it a little bluntly, a stopgap policy.	9	34	212	report
