Perhaps during this period he can exchange time for some room and maybe gain a little more if he leans on the party chairman to gain, to gain resources.	11	44	99	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	911.331	922.466	Li_Feng	female	native	Then what do you think of it, Professor Zheng? Say Yu Shyi-kun prolongs such a long time to buy time for himself; is it because he is hoping his opponents will make a mistake, or is it because he can try to grasp more opportunities to perform?	11	45	100	filler	statement

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1053.429	1065.726	speaker#2	female	native	In another Taiwan media report, under the incitation from the Party Central Committee of the Democratic Progressive Party, the island's pro-Green media and underground broadcasting stations launched a new round of attacks on reformists within the Democratic Progressive Party, naming 11 individuals in the Progressive Democratic Party and calling them the "11 enemies."	12	48	110	report	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1065.726	1074.818	speaker#2	female	native	The Taiwan media also reported that Yu Shyi-kun has been busy cultivating the grassroots level all over Taiwan, instated over 4,000 party affair commissioners who are scattered in villages everywhere in Taiwan, which has created a base of support for himself to participate in the elections.	12	48	111	report	statement

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1080.957	1091.973	Li_Feng	female	native	So we saw that, ah, whether it was that the Central Committee of the Democratic Progressive Party incited the pro-Green media to begin the battle to encircle and suppress the "11 enemies," or 'spilling the beans' that Yu Shyi-kun reported on there being 15 reformist public opinion representatives	13	49	113	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1091.973	1106.114	Li_Feng	female	native	who used to threaten him about seceding from the party, asking him to dismiss Chen Shui-bian, it seems that Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun is enlarging the so-called conflict in the Democratic Progressive Party between the reformists and the loyalists in order to push this, what they call, movement of exposing and criticizing.	13	49	114	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1106.114	1112.052	Li_Feng	female	native	So what do you think about all this, Professor Zheng? Through this type of conduct, what kinds of objective is Yu Shyi-kun trying to achieve?	13	49	115	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1112.052	1127.374	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	It's simple; the loyalists are the mob of pawns, running dogs in Yu Shyi-kun and Chen Shui-bian's clan, while the reformists are, in fact, those within the Democratic Progressive Party who are referred as the New Wave Faction.	13	50	116	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1127.374	1139.790	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	And the New Wave Faction is pampered in the DPP, occupying many favorable positions for a long period of time. In the battle of the cliques of the Democratic Progressive Party, everybody has been discontented with the New Wave taking the lead as early as a long time ago.	13	50	117	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1139.790	1148.863	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	When Yu Shyi-kun attacked the reformists, the so-called 11 enemies, at this time everyone is aware that that was aiming at the New Wave.	13	50	118	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1148.863	1153.469	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	With the attack on the New Wave, the deep-Green constituency certainly welcomed it with open arms.	13	50	119	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1153.469	1164.344	Lan_Xuan	female	native	In addition, ah, during this time, the deep-Green underground broadcasting stations, uh, desperately tried to encircle and suppress the so-called New Wave Faction within the Democratic Progressive Party because the members in the faction were talking about, uh, reform.	13	51	120	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1164.344	1182.531	Lan_Xuan	female	native	Okay, so now Yu Shyi-kun jumps up at this time and echoes the views of the underground broadcasting stations, saying that these people are indeed, the intentions of those from the New Wave are really vicious, and even at the time when the uproar over the state's confidential expenses most likely could have skyrocketed to its highest level, they were unexpectedly thinking about the dismissal of Chen Shui-bian, ah, threatened us with secession from the party.	13	51	121	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1182.531	1201.604	Lan_Xuan	female	native	I think that the purpose of, Yu, those, Shyi-kun's comments was to chime in once, once again with the underground broadcasting stations or deep-Green people, what they sang in their minds, and the most main purpose again was to attract their votes and support when the primary takes place inside the DPP, or possibly even for support in any feasible match with others after a defeat in the primary.	13	51	122	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1201.604	1224.479	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	The party members who have registered with the Democratic Progressive Party and pay the party dues are the people usually deeply committed to the Green ideology. That is to say that the deep-Green constituency dominates this group, and the volume of this kind of constituency's voice is extremely loud, which will certainly have an impact on which candidate is produced from the primary of the Democratic Progressive Party.	13	52	123	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1224.479	1238.859	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	So because of this, all those with the intention to take part in the primary of the Democratic Progressive Party, supposing that he needs to get through the two passes of both polls and the primary of the party members, will certainly need to head in a direction that draws close to the deep-Green.	13	52	124	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1238.859	1250.575	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	But, on another level, that is, even if you get through this, this, um, candidacy pass, then you have to face all the, the 23 million voters in Taiwan.	13	52	125	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1250.575	1272.896	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	This is something totally different to consider, why? Because this is the election competing for the first, in the election situation of competing for the first, everyone should gravitate toward the center as much as possible, and go after the most constituency support. This is what we call a two-phase game strategy in game theory; the first phase you need to first consider a strategy for within your party, and the second phase you need to think about how to deal with the entire electorate of Taiwan as well.	13	52	126	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1272.896	1296.250	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	So like the type of candidates Su Tseng-chang and Frank Hsieh are, they are thinking that they have a good chance of becoming a candidate for the key position of 2008, so their expressions on political views have some green overtones yet they don't dare lean to too-deep green; they talk of independence yet don't push the point too much. Other people say that Su Tseng-chang is drawing closer to the Green side, but let's not forget that Su Tseng-chang has not totally abandoned the soft middle section.	13	52	127	filler	statement

CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1401.231	1405.537	speaker#2	female	native	January 15, 2006, Yu Shyi-kun was elected Chairman of the Progressive Democratic Party.	14	54	140	report	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1405.537	1420.260	Li_Feng	female	native	So then, Yu Shyi-kun has been engaged in politics for 25 years. Professor Zheng, if you could answer please, what kind of evaluation do you think the various circles in Taiwan have on his political capabilities and competency; what kind of style does he have in handling matters?	15	55	141	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1420.260	1436.896	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Yu Shyi-kun, he is, well, as a politician, he doesn't really have the eloquence of speech or charisma like Chen Shui-bian or Frank Hsieh. When he stood addressing the public, you might think about dozing off if you have to listen to him for a long time.	15	56	142	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1436.896	1450.841	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	So then, what are the strong points of Yu Shyi-kun? He personally attends to almost everything; Yu Shyi-kun actually works pretty hard. You can see from the experiences of his childhood, what he likes to talk about most is how he used to herd cows as a child.	15	56	143	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1450.841	1462.810	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Every time he was herding cows and would see others going to school, in his heart he would cry out, why can't I go be like those, those children and go to school? During his term as Premier,	15	56	144	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1462.810	1474.579	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	we could find out that he really didn't create any breakthrough for Taiwan, his economic policies were a flop and his staff and crew were not really all that brilliant.	15	56	145	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1474.579	1481.049	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	Other people have said that Yu Shyi-kun, this character, there are two reasons why he is in politics and able to get to such a high position.	15	56	146	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1481.049	1485.716	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	The first reason is that he was absolutely obedient to Chen Shui-bian.	15	56	147	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1485.716	1488.450	Zheng_You_Ping	male	native	The second reason it that he has had good luck.	15	56	148	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1488.450	1507.560	Lan_Xuan	female	native	In Taiwan there are many people that describe him as (()) so stupid Kun. However, after I slowly came to understand him, I realized that he is not stupid at all. In the past when he was serving as the, ah, Vice Premier of, um, Taiwan, he used to ask for a resignation for a Bazhangxi Incident. At that time everyone applauded for him and thought him to be a very humble person.	15	57	149	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1507.560	1522.912	Lan_Xuan	female	native	However, gradually, I realized that he often would retreat in order to advance, a wolf in sheep's clothing. On the outside he seemed simple and honest but he was really making a move, some plan, some arrangement, that actually exceeds any shrewdness you could imagine.	15	57	150	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1522.912	1543.993	Lan_Xuan	female	native	I realized that this guy has skills to recruit people to form factions, and much more carefully calculating, compared to Su Tseng-chang and compared to Hsieh, Frank Hsieh. I heard what the aides next to him had to say; early on he quietly set up an office, the time was merely 2005 or 2006 and he was already preparing to command a campaign for 2008.	15	57	151	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1543.993	1554.369	Lan_Xuan	female	native	So I was just thinking what Professor Zheng said, something is right when he said that he doesn't have much strength but he has high ambition, so of course he hopes that it would be great if an upright leader would come participate in the election.	15	57	152	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1554.369	1564.118	Lan_Xuan	female	native	But, advancing can launch an attack and retreat defend; if it doesn't work out, doesn't work out then I can just fall back and maybe just serve as an assistant for someone else, in a word, you will always need me, yeah.	15	57	153	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1564.118	1580.053	Lan_Xuan	female	native	So, besides the advantages that Yu Shyi-kun can gain for himself, I think there is another very, very important one. All this time, he has posed himself as a loyalist, and the loyalists are in fact loyal Chen Shui-bian-ists; if he can protect and defend Chen Shui-bian, it would be of certain benefit to him.	15	57	154	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1580.053	1595.209	Lan_Xuan	female	native	The latest information has come out, including Lu Hsiu-lien and Yu Shyi-kun, all affirm, yeah, jeez {lipsmack}. There are four people that want to contend, isn't that right? So let's just not hold the primary election in the party, we instead coordinate among ourselves, and if there is to be coordination then who will do the coordinating? {lipsmack} It should probably still be Chen Shui-bian.	15	57	155	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1595.209	1609.584	Lan_Xuan	female	native	So I think that to a certain degree, Yu Shyi-kun hopes that he can kill two birds with one stone by helping himself and Chen Shui-bian. If only I can show absolute devotion to Chen Shui-bian and make him happy and get in his graces, in the future, to Yu Shyi-Kun, Chen Shui-bian is sure to, sure to pay back.	15	57	156	filler	statement
CCTV4_ACROSSSTRAIT_CMN_20070109_113000	0	1609.584	1627.131	Li_Feng	female	native	A wording to describe the Chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party Yu Shyi-kun inside the island, ha, is "Yu Shyi-kun, loyalist to the death." Everyone is aware of the extraordinary relationship between him and Chen Shui-bian, which is to a different extent than that of the other three Heavenly Kings: Su Tseng-chang, Lu Hsiu-lien, and Frank Hsieh, who comparatively are trying to cut themselves away from Chen Shui-bian.	15	58	157	filler	statement
