It's more than the Confucians. Instead schools such as the Mohists, Mo-tse, Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi, and even the Yin-Yang School and Sun Zi's Art of War are all, all part of the Chinese culture.	4	7	28	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	539.980	555.840	Li_Xiao_Meng	female	native	Yes, uh-huh.	4	7	29	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	555.840	573.077	Xu_Fu_Ji	male	native	However, Confucius is at the core of the Confucian thought in the Chinese culture. For instance the educational thought of Confucius, like "teaching without discrimination" and his "aiming for harmony rather than uniformity," are still the criteria even, even, even they are applied in the current day or universally.	4	7	30	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	555.840	573.077	Li_Xiao_Meng	female	native	Yes, uh-huh.	4	7	31	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	573.077	582.101	Xu_Fu_Ji	male	native	Ah, so I think although the Chinese language and culture is certainly broad, if we are to find a core, ah the Confucians are the most important, yes.	4	7	32	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	573.077	582.101	Li_Xiao_Meng	female	native	Yes, uh-huh.	4	7	33	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	582.101	607.103	Xu_Fu_Ji	male	native	What ((pw)) I revere most about the Confucians is harmony, putting people first, harmony, as well as the so-called aiming for harmony rather than uniformity, that is one can put oneself at the center, that is to put people at the center, while accommodating more diversified ah thoughts. Ah, this is the concept of aiming for harmony rather than uniformity that I revere most about the Confucians.	4	7	34	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	582.101	607.103	Li_Xiao_Meng	female	native	What do you think are the concepts you revere most in the Confucian culture? en, en, en.	4	7	35	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	607.103	617.808	Xu_Fu_Ji	male	native	Uh, we try to incorporate it into such, such aspects as our promotion of the Chinese language.	4	7	36	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	607.103	617.808	Li_Xiao_Meng	female	native	Can your personal understanding penetrate into your teaching design at the Confucius Institute.

Uh the Confucius Institute uh is different in many ways from some faculties of Chinese language overseas, because -- because it is a fairly, that is a fairly novel concept, which is actually very similar to the, the <foreign lang="English"> </foreign> of the British Council and Germany's Goethe-Institut. Ah it hopes to be a a -- ((pw)) a similar cultural promotion.	4	7	38	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	617.808	647.656	Li_Xiao_Meng	female	native	I reckon what people want to know most are the differences between the current Confucius Institute and the faculty of Chinese Language or the Chinese language major mentioned in a university. En, right, en.	4	7	39	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	647.656	662.126	Xu_Fu_Ji	male	native	So the uh events or courses it promotes range from preschool children to primary school, high school uh university students to adults. That's why ((pw)) it's quite different in nature from the faculty or center of the Chinese Language.	4	7	40	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	647.656	662.126	Li_Xiao_Meng	female	native	Yes, uh-huh.	4	7	41	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	662.126	667.919	Li_Xiao_Meng	female	native	Is learning at the Institute uh a kind of further study, or will a diploma recognized by the government be awarded?	4	8	42	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	667.919	679.188	Xu_Fu_Ji	male	native	Ah, right. Our current programs are quite diversified. Ah some are professional diploma programs, which means ah Hanban will give them a certificate after they complete the program and our university, Nanyang Technological University Confucius Institute, will give them a certificate.	4	9	43	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	679.188	701.627	Xu_Fu_Ji	male	native	Some are short courses for further study, say three days or five days. Most are sort of cultural immersion programs. For example, we have organized trips to China for students, university and senior high students, as well as some teachers, for ah cultural immersion programs, uh, which are what is called overseas study trips and courses. So, our current programs are very diversified.	4	10	44	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	679.188	701.627	Li_Xiao_Meng	female	native	Yes, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.	4	10	45	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	741.963	751.184	Li_Xiao_Meng	female	native	As far as you know, out of what purposes do people, no matter small kids or adults ah, come to the Confucius Institute to learn?

((pw)) since the Chinese culture is broad and deep and ((pw)) some students uh cannot attain a high level anytime soon, they have taken some Chinese language course, such as basic Chinese, and then they understand the Chinese culture through the language.	6	13	48	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	751.184	778.564	Li_Xiao_Meng	female	native	Ah.	6	13	49	filler	statementCCTVNEWS_PEOPLEINNEWS_CMN_20060711_215701	0	778.564	792.114	Xu_Fu_Ji	male	native	That's why we have a slogan, which is "constantly experience the endless pleasures of China," meaning ((pw)) in the Chinese culture uh, there are many touching and many pleasant things.
